// The §12.56 compute-pipeline watchdog re-rolls a `createComputePipelineAsync`
// that never settles. It shipped broken and stayed broken silently, because a
// failed re-roll looks exactly like the wedge it was trying to heal: the pass
// keeps being skipped and the console gains one more line.
//
// THE HAZARD, precisely: three does not hand `device.createComputePipeline` a
// fresh descriptor. `WebGPUPipelineUtils.createComputePipeline` fills a
// MODULE-LEVEL SINGLETON (`_computePipelineDescriptor`, class
// GPUComputePipelineDescriptor) and calls `.reset()` on the very next line —
// nulling `layout` and `compute`. GISystem's interceptor used to keep a
// reference to that object for the retry, so every retry re-asked the driver
// with `layout: null` and was rejected:
//
//   Failed to read the 'layout' property from 'GPUPipelineDescriptorBase':
//   The provided value 'null' is not a valid enum value of type GPUAutoLayoutMode
//
// This test drives the real interceptor with a fake backend/device that
// reproduces the reset, and asserts the retry sees a USABLE descriptor. No GPU,
// no browser — the bug is pure object lifetime.
