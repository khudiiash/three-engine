//! Watches the open project folder and tells the editor what changed.
//!
//! ## Why the editor needs this at all
//!
//! Everything the editor knows about a project it read once: the Assets panel
//! listed the directory, the asset loader cached a blob URL per path, the engine
//! decoded a `.geom` into a shared BufferGeometry. Nothing in that chain can
//! notice that the bytes on disk changed, so a file written by anything other
//! than the editor itself — an AI agent using its own file tools, a texture
//! exported from another program, a script edited in an IDE — stayed invisible
//! until the editor was restarted. That is the single most common way "the
//! change didn't apply" is reported, and it is not a bug in whatever wrote the
//! file.
//!
//! ## Self-writes are filtered here, not in the webview
//!
//! The editor saves constantly (autosave, texture flattening, `.meta`
//! sidecars). Echoing those back would at best re-invalidate a cache the editor
//! had just populated and at worst make the open scene reload out from under
//! the user mid-edit. Every editor write goes through a Tauri command, so this
//! module records the path as it is written and drops watcher events for it for
//! a short window afterwards. Doing it here rather than in JS means a new write
//! command cannot forget to opt in — it only has to call `note_self_write`,
//! and the ones that exist already do.
