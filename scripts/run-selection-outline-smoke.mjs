/**
 * The selection outline, measured in pixels, in the real editor.
 *
 * The claim under test is entirely visual and entirely screen-space, so there
 * is nothing a headless unit test could assert about it: the outline is not an
 * object in the scene graph (the bounding box it replaced was), it has no
 * transform to read back, and its whole point is a CONSTANT PIXEL WIDTH around
 * a silhouette — a property that only exists once something has been rasterised.
 * So this reads the live canvas.
 *
 * What it checks:
 *   - orange pixels appear just OUTSIDE a selected box's silhouette, and only
 *     there: not further out, and not across the object's own face (an outline
 *     that fills the shape is the classic dilate-without-subtracting-the-mask
 *     bug, and it looks perfectly fine in a thumbnail),
 *   - the ring traces the SILHOUETTE and not a bounding box — measured on a
 *     45°-yawed box, where the two differ by definition,
 *   - it closes over the top edge as well as the sides (a separable dilation
 *     that only ran on one axis passes every other check here),
 *   - deselecting removes it, and the Gizmos layer toggle owns it,
 *   - Play starts with a separate, all-off Layers state; Colliders can then be
 *     enabled without exposing the other editor layers, including every
 *     primitive and geometry-derived collider overlay in the scene,
 *   - a clean screenshot still excludes physics-debug overlays, while
 *     `includeGizmos` captures them and neither capture changes the live mask,
 *   - Stop restores the exact edit-mode Layers state that preceded Play,
 *   - the active object is drawn in a lighter orange than the rest of the
 *     selection (Blender's distinction),
 *   - the mask pass leaves no trace: every layer mask and visibility flag it
 *     touches is the same after a frame as before, which is what keeps it from
 *     quietly dismantling static batching,
 *   - and `viewport.screenshot(includeGizmos)` shows it, so an agent can see
 *     what the user sees.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THIS HARNESS HAD TO LEARN, both of which cost a debugging round:
 *
 *   - The measurement runs INSIDE a post-render callback, not in a `requestAnimationFrame`
 *     after the fact. The editor's frame pacing suspends the render loop when
 *     nothing is changing, and `drawImage` of a WebGPU canvas that did not
 *     render this frame returns a BLANK image — not the last frame. Read from
 *     outside the loop and every pixel is zero, which looks exactly like "the
 *     feature draws nothing". `__editorKeepRendering` (the pin flag
 *     `editorFramePacing.js` already honours) keeps the loop alive.
 *   - Post-render callbacks run in registration order, so a capture registered
 *     after the panel's own outline pass sees the composited frame.
 *
 * The measurements themselves also run inside the page — a 1280x800 frame is
 * four million numbers, and moving that across the bridge is slower than the
 * render it is measuring.
 *
