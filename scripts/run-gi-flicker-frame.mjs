// PER-FRAME GI FLICKER INSTRUMENT — sees what the eye sees.
//
// The screenshot-based run-gi-flicker.mjs captures every ~17 rendered frames
// (viewport.screenshot RTT), so per-frame churn that settles within a few
// frames is INVISIBLE to it — and that per-frame churn is exactly the
// "flicker gets crazy when objects move" report. This harness instead runs a
// tiny GPU accumulator over the GI RESOLVE TEXTURE on every rendered frame:
// per half-res pixel it tracks luminance, counts DIRECTION REVERSALS of the
// per-frame delta (the popping signature), and the mover advances a
// SUB-VOXEL step per frame (a realistic ~1m/s object at 120fps), all
// in-page at full frame rate. One readback at the end.

  //
  // ⚠⚠ READ THIS BEFORE QUOTING `netSettle` AS LAG. IT IS CONFOUNDED AND THE
  // 2026-08-12 sweep proved it by its own numbers. The intent was: a lagging
  // field slides monotonically into place when the light stops, while
  // per-frame variance is zero-mean and cancels. The second half is FALSE as
  // implemented — variance is zero-mean in the SIGNED difference, but this
  // averages |Δ| over pixels, and E|X| for zero-mean noise is positive and
  // grows with σ. So the statistic reads the NOISE of its two endpoint
  // snapshots, not the systematic displacement between them.
  //
  // The measurement refutes itself, which is the only reason it is trustworthy
  // as a negative: EMA lag for a ramp input scales as (1−α)/α, so α=0.02
  // should read ~5× MORE lag than α=0.1. It read 1.6× LESS (0.0115 vs 0.0188),
  // tracking σ instead. A column that moves the wrong way with α is measuring
  // the wrong quantity.
  //
  // THE CORRECT INSTRUMENT, for whoever builds it next: average over PASSES,
  // not over time. Park the sun at a test angle, converge, and time-average to
  // get a noise-free TRUTH for that angle; then let the ping-pong carry the
  // sun through that same angle N times, sampling the live field at each
  // crossing. Lag is identical every pass while noise falls as 1/√N, so the
  // two separate. Do NOT try to time-average the live field instead — the sun
  // sweeps ~17° through a 60-frame window, so the averaging smears exactly the
  // signal being measured, and shortening the window to fix that reintroduces
  // an α-dependent convergence bias (20 frames is ~2 time constants at α=0.1
  // and nearly none at α=0.02).
