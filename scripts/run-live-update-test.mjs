// Live-update guard: does anything stateful still assume it is evaluated once?
//
//   node scripts/run-live-update-test.mjs
//
// No browser, no dev server — this is a source scan, and it runs in a second.
//
// ## The bug class it guards
//
// A module-level `const store = create(...)` or `const cache = new Map()` is a
// singleton only while the module is evaluated once, and in this app that is not
// guaranteed: Vite rewrites `import()` specifiers for a changed module to a
// `?t=<mtime>` URL, and a fresh URL is a fresh module instance while the old one
// stays live in React's tree. The same file is also reachable as `/src/…` and
// `/@fs/C:/…`.
//
// When that happens to something stateful the editor splits in half, silently:
// MCP-driven edits push into one command bus while the mounted panels subscribe
// to the other; an asset invalidation clears one cache while the renderer reads
// the other. Nothing throws, the engine really is mutated, and everything
// autosaves — so the change "only appears after a restart", which reads as the
// feature being broken.
//
// `vmSingleton` (editor) and `vmState` (engine) are the fix. The point of this
// test is that the list of things that need them cannot quietly grow again:
// every new zustand store is checked automatically, and the caches and
// registries that were wrapped by hand stay wrapped.
