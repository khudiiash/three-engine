// MCP coverage: can an agent do what a person can do?
//
//   node scripts/run-mcp-coverage-test.mjs
//
// No browser, no dev server — a source scan over the module catalogue and the
// op registry.
//
// ## Why this is a test and not a checklist
//
// "Every feature ships with MCP tools" is a rule that cannot be enforced by
// remembering it. A module that ships without ops breaks nothing: the panel
// works, every test passes, and the missing capability is invisible from inside
// the editor — you only find it much later, when an agent is asked to do
// something and quietly cannot. By then the feature is "finished" and nobody
// wants to reopen it.
//
// So the catalogue is the source of truth here. A new module under src/modules/
// joins this test the moment it registers an id, and it must either have ops or
// say — in COMPONENT_ONLY below, with a reason — why its whole surface is
// already reachable through component.setProp. "I forgot" is not one of the
// available answers.

// --- component properties: the half of the surface that is not an op ---------
//
// COMPONENT_ONLY below is only honest if `component.setProp` really can reach
// everything, and reaching a property means being able to name a legal VALUE
// for it. `component.types` is the one channel for that: it projects each
// schema's key/label/type/options, and for a `select` the `options` array IS
// the enum. A select that declares none is a property an assistant can only set
// by guessing — and guessing wrong is silent, because the command bus stores
// whatever it is handed and the inspector is the only thing that would have
// constrained it. That is the failure this file exists to catch, one layer down
// from a missing op: the tool is there, the property is there, and the agent
// still cannot use it.
//
// The mesh's giMobility/giTrace pair (the 2026-08-07 split of `giDynamic`) is
// exactly this case — neither tag has an op of its own, and neither needs one,
// so their options list is the whole of their MCP surface.

 * for them, because a button is a capability `component.setProp` cannot reach.
