// Call an editor op from the shell, through the same MCP server an assistant uses.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The editor's op registry is reachable three ways: the
// Inspector (a human), an MCP client (an assistant with the server registered),
// and nothing else. A session whose MCP client was never given `three-engine`
// — or a shell script, or CI — had no way in at all, which is awkward because
// the ops are the project's own supported automation surface and the standing
// rule is that every feature must be drivable by an agent.
//
// This is a thin CLI over `mcp/server.mjs`: it spawns the same stdio server,
// which dials the same broker on ENGINE_MCP_PORT, which routes to whatever
// editor is attached. Nothing new is bound and nothing is bypassed, so this
// cannot collide with a live assistant session — the broker exists precisely to
// let N sessions share one editor.
//
//   node scripts/engine-op.mjs --list
//   node scripts/engine-op.mjs profile_giPasses
//   node scripts/engine-op.mjs component_setProp '{"id":"...","type":"...","key":"...","value":1}'
//
// Prints the tool's JSON result to stdout and nothing else, so it pipes.
// Diagnostics go to stderr. Exits non-zero if the editor is not attached — a
// silent empty result would be indistinguishable from an op that returned
// nothing, which is the failure mode this project keeps re-learning.
