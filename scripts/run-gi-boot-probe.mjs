// GI BOOT PROBE — R18's instrument. Plan §13.5.
//
// The requirement is "GI initialization ≤ 1 second to first correct frame".
// §13.2 measured the current figure at 45-90 s on the user's Sponza and found
// ~98% of it in the WGSL compiler — but with ONE number for the whole compile
// wave, so "which kernel costs the 40 seconds" was unanswerable. This answers
// it, and separates the question everything else is conditional on: COLD vs
// WARM.
//
// ══ HOW IT MEASURES, AND WHY IT TOUCHES NO ENGINE CODE ══════════════════════
//
// It patches `GPUDevice.prototype` in the page before any script runs
// (`evaluateOnNewDocument`), recording every shader module's WGSL size and every
// pipeline creation's wall time. That is a pure observer: no GISystem edit, no
// instrumentation to leave behind, and it sees BOTH backends and every pipeline
// regardless of which list the engine keeps it in — `[gi] compute kernels` only
// counts `state.queue`, which is why its 5 kernels do not explain a 3-pipeline
// 86-second wave.
//
// GISystem's own `installAsyncComputePipelines` patches the device INSTANCE and
// calls `device.createComputePipelineAsync(...)`, which resolves to this
// prototype patch — so the interception composes rather than fighting.
//
// ══ COLD VS WARM ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Chrome's compiled-shader disk cache lives in the browser profile. COLD wipes
// the profile directory; WARM relaunches against the same one. §13.4 makes this
// item 1 because it decides which lever matters at all: if WARM is already
// sub-second, this is a developer-iteration problem needing a shipped cache, not
// a kernel diet.
//
// Both arms run the SAME project and scene as `run-gi-game-perf-probe`, so
// startup and steady-state numbers are comparable within one session (R15).
//
// Run:  node scripts/run-gi-boot-probe.mjs [baseUrl]
// Env:  PROJECT=<path>   ARMS=cold,warm   HEADED=1   TIMEOUT=<seconds>
