/**
 * Automatic static MERGING — the case instancing cannot reach.
 *
 * `batching.js` collapses meshes that repeat: same geometry, same material, many
 * transforms, one `InstancedMesh`. That is the right answer for a scene built by
 * dropping one crate a thousand times, and it is worth exactly nothing on an
 * imported environment, where every mesh is unique. Sponza is the canonical
 * shape of the problem: 26 meshes, 26 geometries, 26 materials, no repetition at
 * all, and 26 draw calls in every pass that touches it — main colour, depth
 * prepass, shadow map — for 78 of a 90-call frame.
 *
 * Those 26 materials are not 26 different SHADERS, though. They are one shader
 * with 26 rows of data: `applyStockPbr` already expresses each as plain colour /
 * roughness / metalness / map / normalMap, so what separates two draws is which
 * texture is bound. So this concatenates their geometry into one buffer, tags
 * every vertex with which row it came from, and draws the lot with the single
 * table-driven material `uberMaterial.js` builds.
 *
 * Merging is not free and this file is mostly about what it refuses to do.
 *
 * ## Frustum culling
 *
 * A merged proxy is culled as one object, so merging can trade draw calls for
 * triangles. On the scene this was built for it costs nothing: each Sponza mesh
 * is one MATERIAL's worth of surface scattered across the whole atrium, so its
 * bounding sphere already covers the model and no camera has ever culled one.
 * Where that is not true — props spread over a landscape — merging them into one
 * blob would submit the whole landscape every frame. `MAX_MERGE_RADIUS_RATIO`
 * is the guard: a group whose merged bound is much larger than its members'
 * typical bound is refusing a real cull, and is left alone.
 *
 * ## Motion
 *
 * Merging BAKES world transforms into the vertex buffer, so a member that moves
 * would drag its geometry behind it. Instancing can afford movers (rewrite one
 * matrix); merging cannot (rewrite the mesh). Rather than ask the author to
 * label things static, this watches: a member whose world matrix changes is
 * marked unstable, permanently for the session, and the group rebuilds without
 * it. A crate that gets shoved once is never merged again.
 *
 * ## What sees what
 *
 * Members are hidden with `mesh.visible = false` and left in the scene graph —
 * the same protocol `batching.js` uses, and for its reasons: three's Raycaster
 * tests `layers` and never `visible`, so editor picking, bounds and the
 * selection outline keep resolving to the real per-entity meshes, while the
 * proxy opts out of raycasting so a click never lands on it. The renderer skips
 * an invisible object during scene projection, so a hidden member costs nothing
 * in any pass — including the occluder pass, which renders by layer.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ONE THING THAT DOES CHANGE: the GI module builds its albedo atlas by
 * reading `material.map` on the CPU (`bvh/bvhScene.js buildAlbedoAtlas`). An
 * uber material has no `.map` — its colour lives in a texture array the CPU side
 * cannot index — so a merged surface contributes its group's AVERAGE tint to
 * GI's BVH reflection albedo instead of its own texture. Direct lighting, shadows
 * and the voxel field are unaffected. That is why this system is OFF by default:
 * `settings.performance.staticMerging`.

 * The coarsest a locality cell may be, as a fraction of the SCENE's diagonal.
 *
 * ## Why a scene-relative floor exists at all
 *
 * `MAX_MERGE_RADIUS_RATIO` sizes a cell from the MEMBERS' own mean radius, and
 * on a room-sized scene that is the whole answer. On an imported city it is a
 * trap that scales the wrong way: a group of café chairs has a mean radius of
 * ~0.4 m, so its cell comes out at ~2 m, and forty chairs scattered down a
 * 115 m street land in forty different cells — every one of them below
 * `MIN_GROUP_SIZE`, so NONE of them merge.
 *
 * Measured on Bistro (2026-08-17), that is exactly what happened: the main pass
 * drew one material **31 times** and another 29 times with same-material
 * merging fully enabled and eligible, because the split had already diced those
 * meshes into singletons before the merge was ever attempted. The rule was
 * refusing to merge small objects at ANY distance, which is precisely backwards
 * — small scattered props are the cheapest thing to merge and the most numerous.
 *
 * ## Why this is still safe for culling
 *
 * The thing culling actually cares about is the proxy's bound relative to the
 * SCENE, not relative to its members: a 19 m blob on a 115 m street is an
 * ordinary spatial chunk, and dicing the scene into ~6 cells per axis is what a
 * chunked renderer would do anyway. Tying cell size to object size instead means
 * a scene of small objects can never be chunked at all.
 *
 * So the cell is `max(member-relative, scene-relative)` — room-sized scenes keep
 * the old behaviour exactly (their scene diagonal is small, so the floor never
 * binds), and a city gets chunks instead of singletons.

/**
 * Ceiling on the triangles ONE merged proxy may carry.
 *
 * ## Merging trades draw calls for GRANULARITY, and downstream systems buy that
 *
 * A proxy is one object to everything after merging: one frustum cull, one entry
 * in GI's reflection BVH, one occupancy slot, one surface-record owner. Those
 * systems are budgeted PER OBJECT, so a proxy that swallows a whole city block
 * does not just cost more — it can exceed a per-object limit and get dropped
 * entirely, which is worse than not merging at all.
 *
 * Measured on Bistro (2026-08-17), immediately after the scene-relative locality
 * floor let groups grow properly:
 *
 * ```
 * [gi] bvh: skipping "Merged(4)" (166676 tris > 150000 bvh cap)
 * [gi] surface records: 2036452/2097152 claimed, triangles 4241682/2097152,
 *      300306 dense cells exceed the per-cell exact-triangle limit
 * ```
 *
 * The triangle pool went from comfortably inside its budget to **2× over**, and
 * the count of cells falling back to coarse voxel-box hits went **24 701 →
 * 300 306**. On screen that is the user's report: *"when I start moving the
 * camera, there are black patches in some area, that starts filling with light,
 * or turning black again"* — surfaces whose exact triangles no longer fit lose
 * their records, and which ones lose them changes as the GI detail box follows
 * the camera.
 *
 * So the budget is set BELOW `MAX_TRIS_PER_BVH_MESH` (150 000 in
 * `gi/bvh/bvhScene.js`) with headroom, because a proxy that trips that cap is
 * silently excluded from exact reflections and traced shadows. A group over
 * budget is CHUNKED, not refused: the draw-call saving is kept, the granularity
 * is kept, and nothing downstream gets an object it cannot represent.
 *
 * ⚠ This is a coupling to another module's constant and it should stay

 * WHY a mesh cannot join a SAME-MATERIAL merge, or `null` when it can.

 * ## This is the cheap merge, and it should have been the FIRST one
 *
 * The uber path above answers "how do I draw N meshes with N DIFFERENT materials
 * in one call", and its answer — copy every source texture into an array and
 * shade from a table — is expensive and lossy: it costs texture memory that is
 * pure ADDITION (the originals stay resident for the hidden members), it mints a
 * new `Uber(n)` material that GI must compile a fresh shader variant for, and it
 * can only express the four `UBER_SLOTS`, so `uberIncompatibility` turns away
 * every material with a custom node, an emissive map or an AO map.
 *
 * None of that applies when the members already share ONE material instance.
 * There is no table to build, no texture to copy, and no new material to
 * compile — the proxy is handed `members[0].material`, the identical object the
 * members were drawing with. The merge is then pure geometry concatenation:
 * bytes of texture memory ZERO, new shader variants ZERO, and the material's own
 * complexity completely irrelevant, because it is never inspected.
 *
 * Measured on Bistro (2026-08-17), this is not a marginal case. The main pass
 * submitted **484 draws over 161 distinct materials** — one material drawn 40
 * times, the next 27, then 21, 19, 17, 16 — every one of them a group the uber
 * path had refused (custom nodes) or run out of texture budget for, and every
 * one of them mergeable here for free.
 *
 * So the gate is narrow on purpose. Only two things can actually go wrong:
 *
 * - **Emissive surfaces.** GI promotes an emissive mesh to a light emitter keyed
 *   on the mesh, so merging two of them into one proxy MOVES the light to the
 *   combined centroid. Same reasoning as `uberIncompatibility`'s, and the same
 *   refusal — this one is about where light comes from, not about shading.
 * - **A material that reads a per-mesh attribute the merge may drop.** Handled
 *   by keying the group on its ATTRIBUTE SET rather than refused here, so a mesh
 *   with no `uv` merges with other uv-less meshes instead of silently stripping
 *   the channel off the ones that have it (`mergeGeometries` keeps an attribute
 *   only when EVERY member has it — that is where "Vertex attribute uv not
 *   found" comes from).
 *
 * Everything else the uber path refuses is fine here, and that is the point.
