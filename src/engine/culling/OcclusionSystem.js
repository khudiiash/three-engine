/**
 * `engine.occlusion` — hides what the depth buffer says is already behind
 * something else (roadmap item 14).
 *
 * Frustum culling answers "could this be on screen"; this answers "would any of
 * it survive the wall in front of it". In an interior, a city street or
 * anything with real occluders that is the difference between drawing the level
 * and drawing the room.
 *
 * ## WebGPU uses Three's native query API
 *
 * WebGPU marks the REAL drawable meshes with `object.occlusionTest` and reads
 * them through `renderer.isOccluded`, exactly like Three's
 * webgpu_occlusion example. The query therefore wraps the object's own draw:
 * it tests against depth that existed BEFORE the object, rather than against
 * depth the object wrote itself. A previous implementation drew a separate
 * AABB after the scene; box-like meshes then occluded their own query because
 * of equal-depth precision and disappeared at random. A unique always-occluded
 * sentinel ties asynchronous results to the camera generation; a late
 * old-camera result fails open instead of making geometry disappear.
 * WebGL retains the depth/readback/CPU Hi-Z fallback below.
 *
 * ## Why the test uses the camera the depth was captured with
 *
 * Applying a stale depth buffer against the CURRENT camera is the mistake that
 * makes occlusion culling flicker whenever the player turns. The view and
 * projection matrices are captured alongside the pixels and the test projects
 * against those, so the buffer and the maths always describe the same frame.
 * What is left over is objects that MOVED in between, which can be culled for
 * one frame as they emerge from behind an occluder — a real limitation, and a
 * far smaller one than the camera moving every frame.
 *
 * ## Only big things are occluders
 *
 * Rendering the whole scene into the depth pass would double draw submission —
 * on a CPU-bound frame, spending exactly the resource this feature exists to
 * save. Only objects above `minOccluderSize` are drawn, tagged with their own
 * layer so the pass skips everything else without even walking it. A blade of
 * grass occludes nothing anyone can measure; a wall occludes half the level.
 *
 * ## What it writes, and the two things it must not break
 *
 *  - Visibility goes through `entity._occluded`, which the engine's per-frame
 *    resolve ANDs in — the same single-writer rule LOD groups follow. Writing
 *    `object3D.visible` here would be overwritten before it was ever drawn.
 *  - A BATCHED mesh cannot be hidden this way at all: it draws through its
 *    `InstancedMesh` proxy, which only re-reads visibility on rebuild, and
 *    invalidating the batch every time one prop went behind a wall would
 *    rebuild the scene's grouping every frame. Batched entities are therefore
 *    skipped, and the PROXIES are tested instead — one test that hides a
 *    hundred props at once, which is strictly better.
 *
 * ## The honest limitation
 *
 * An occluded object stops casting its shadow, because three's shadow pass
 * skips invisible objects. That is the standard trade (Unity and Unreal both
 * make it) and it is usually invisible — an object behind a wall normally has
 * its shadow behind the same wall — but it is not free, and `cullShadowCasters`
 * turns it off for scenes where it shows.

 * top of the screen).
 *
 * Which requires knowing the backend, and getting it wrong is invisible rather
 * than loud. `gl.readPixels` counts rows from the bottom and needs nothing done
 * to it; WebGPU's `copyTextureToBuffer` preserves texture order, so row 0 is
 * the TOP and the buffer has to be flipped. Skipping that flip does not blank
 * the screen or throw — it silently tests every object against the depth of the
 * region MIRRORED vertically about the screen centre. An object high on screen
 * is then compared with whatever is low on screen, and if that happens to be
 * nearby (a floor, a desk, a wall coming towards the camera) the object is
 * culled with nothing whatsoever in front of it. "Meshes vanish in front of the
 * camera, and it depends where I look" is exactly what that produces.
 *
 * See `engine/renderTargetImage.js`, which draws the same distinction for
 * colour readbacks; this one cannot share it because the pyramid wants floats
 * and the opposite row order from an image.
