   *
   * Static, so one tap covers every bus at once — `Engine`, every `Entity`,
   * every `Component` and `InputManager` all extend this class, and a monitor
   * that only saw the global bus would miss exactly the events people get
   * stuck on. The Events panel arms it while it is open (see
   * `engine.events.record`) and disarms it on unmount.
   *
   * Called BEFORE the no-listener early return on purpose: "I emitted it and
   * nothing happened" is the single most common thing to be debugging, and a
   * tap that only fires when somebody is already listening cannot answer it.
