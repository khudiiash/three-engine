 * Everything three owns — `Vector3`, `Object3D`, `Color`, … — is re-exported

 * stylistic preference: this file used to hand-declare ~170 lines of three's
 * math API, and it had silently drifted. It declared `Quaternion.inverse()`,
 * which three renamed to `invert()` years ago, so anyone following
 * autocomplete got a runtime crash. It also declared `Object3D` as a
 * 14-member subset, which lies to the type system exactly when a script
 * reaches for the three escape hatch.
 *
 * A re-export cannot drift. If three renames something, the error surfaces at
 * `tsc` time against the real definition instead of in a user's game. Add
 * nothing here that three already defines.
