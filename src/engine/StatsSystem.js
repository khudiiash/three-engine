/**
 * Built-in per-engine performance sampler. Lives on the engine itself
 * (not as a registered module) — every engine instance has one, the editor
 * never has to "enable" anything, and built games can ignore the readout
 * without paying for a feature flag.
 *
 * What it measures, every frame:
 *
 *   fps         — frames/second from `1000 / dt`, smoothed by a 30-frame EMA
 *                 so the readout is steady but reacts within ~half a second
 *                 to a 60→30 drop
 *   frameMs     — wall time between successive onUpdate() calls (the engine
 *                 #tick minus the render() call that sits between updates)
 *   cpuLoadPct  — frameMs as a percentage of a 16.67 ms budget (60 Hz reference).
 *                 Clamped to 0–100 so a busy frame saturates the bar instead
 *                 of overflowing. The colour tone in the UI keys off the
 *                 underlying frameMs so a saturated-100% frame at 16.7 ms
 *                 doesn't turn red while one at 50 ms does.
 *   renderMs    — wall time of `renderer.render()` alone (the GPU-submit + draw
 *                 portion of the frame; the GPU work happens synchronously on
 *                 WebGL2 and asynchronously on WebGPU, so this is a useful
 *                 proxy but *not* a hardware GPU load reading)
 *   gpuLoadPct  — renderMs over the same 16.67 ms budget, clamped to 0–100
 *   jsHeapBytes — `performance.memory.usedJSHeapSize` (Chromium-based hosts
 *                 only; `null` elsewhere)
 *   drawCalls   — `renderer.info.render.drawCalls` (per-frame; the `calls`
 *                 field on three.js r185 WebGPURenderer is cumulative since
 *                 startup — different field, do NOT use it here)
 *   triangles   — `renderer.info.render.triangles` (last frame)
 *   textureMem  — `renderer.info.memory.texturesSize` (sum of every tracked
 *                 texture's byte size — close to a real "GPU texture memory"
 *                 reading, though three does not track every backend-level
 *                 allocation so this can undercount large render targets)
 *
 * The system keeps no on-screen presence of its own; hosts read
 * `engine.stats.readout` whenever they want to display data.
 *
 * Sampling timing is subtle. The WebGPU/WebGL animation loop
 * (`renderer.setAnimationLoop`) resets three's per-frame metrics to zero
 * at the START of each frame, BEFORE the user's animation callback runs.
 * Inside the callback the engine fires `onUpdate` first, then calls
 * `renderer.render(...)`. Reading `info.render.drawCalls` from inside
 * `onUpdate` therefore always sees 0 — the render that populates it
 * hasn't happened yet. To get correct readings, `Engine.#tick()` calls
 * `engine.stats.recordRenderInfo()` AFTER `renderer.render()` returns;
 * that's when three's per-frame metrics are populated with the just-
 * rendered frame's data. The StatsSystem stores them in the readout; the
 * overlay reads the readout on its next 10 Hz poll.
 *
 * The renderer.render() wall time is captured by `Engine.#tick()` calling
 * `engine.stats.recordRenderMs(...)` around the render call. This keeps the
 * measurement isolated to the GPU-submit portion of the frame, so the CPU
 * reading doesn't double-count the GPU work.
