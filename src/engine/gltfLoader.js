/**
 * Shared GLTF loader with Draco decoding wired in.
 *
 * The Draco module (src/modules/draco) compresses imported models with
 * KHR_draco_mesh_compression; decoding is the reverse side of that and is
 * ALWAYS available here — a compressed .glb must still load even if a project
 * later disables the module. Plain (uncompressed) .glb files are unaffected:
 * DRACOLoader only kicks in for meshes carrying the extension, and its wasm
 * decoder is fetched lazily on the first compressed mesh, so projects that
 * never use Draco pay nothing.
 *
 * The decoder binaries live in `public/draco/` (copied from three's glTF Draco
 * libs) and ship with both the editor and exported games. The path is left
 * RELATIVE ("draco/") on purpose: DRACOLoader resolves it against the current
 * document URL, which matches how the exported player loads everything else by
 * relative URL — so a game hosted under a subpath (or opened from file://)
 * still finds its decoder. The editor SPA lives at the root, so it resolves to
 * "/draco/" there.

 * diffuse -> base color, glossiness -> roughness, and specular RGB -> the
 * modern KHR_materials_specular extension. A combined spec/gloss texture can
 * preserve its RGB specular channels; its alpha gloss channel has no direct

 * clip whose keyframes live at t∈[19.77, 20.83]. three.js reads its duration
 * as 20.83s and — because there are no keyframes before 19.77s — holds the
 * first keyframe for the first ~19.8 seconds. Played from time 0 the model
 * looks frozen on one pose, twitches for a second, then loops back to frozen.
 *
 * Shifting every track by the clip's global minimum time fixes this: the
 * earliest keyframe lands at 0, inter-track offsets are preserved, and
 * `resetDuration()` recomputes the real length. Idempotent — a clip already
 * based at zero is left untouched, so re-loading a model can't double-shift.
