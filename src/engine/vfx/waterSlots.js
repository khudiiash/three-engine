/**
 * ══ THE WATER SLOT POOL — WHY THE BINDINGS ARE ENGINE-OWNED ════════════════
 *
 * Three consumers need to read a water surface every frame: the underwater
 * medium (`waterMedium.js`, a node on `scene.fogNode`), the raster caustic
 * light, and the GI sun term inside `srcShade.js`. All three are compiled
 * graphs, and in this engine a graph that binds a texture belonging to a
 * COMPONENT is a graph that must be rebuilt whenever that component is — a
 * resolution edit, a detach, a play/stop. For the GI kernels that is a
 * multi-second compile wave; for `scene.fogNode` it is every material in the
 * project.
 *
 * So the textures do not belong to the water. A fixed pool of slots is
 * allocated once per engine and lives for its lifetime; a water surface CLAIMS
 * a slot and renders into it, and every consumer binds the slot. Water can
 * appear, change resolution and vanish without a single graph rebuild — an
 * empty slot simply publishes `active = 0`, which every consumer already reads
 * as "no water here".
 *
 * That is also why the slot textures are a FIXED 128², rather than the solver's
 * own grid: the size is part of the binding. A coarse solver is resampled up
 * (smoothly — the source is linearly filtered), which is the right direction
 * anyway, because a caustic is a lens and its detail should not step with the
 * simulation's cell size.

 * vertex per SOLVER cell (capped at 256), and the fine detail that actually
 * makes caustics was then sampled at 4 cm on a 5 m pool and at 47 cm on a 60 m

 * ⭐ **AND IT CARRIES A MIP CHAIN, WHICH IS WHAT MAKES LIGHT SHAFTS SMOOTH.**

 * of a high-contrast field is a noisy estimate however cleverly the taps are
 * dithered — the dither only decides whether the error looks like banding or
 * like grain. "Can we make the underwater godrays a bit smoother, less
 * dithered? They look too noisy... and probably they are changing way too fast"
 * (user, 2026-09-06) is both symptoms of that one variance.
 *
 * A prefiltered copy fixes it at the source, and a mip chain is a prefiltered
 * copy the hardware already knows how to build — the WebGPU backend generates
 * it after the pass that fills this target. The shafts read a coarse level and

/**
 * == CAUSTICS ARE A RASTERIZED PROJECTION, WHICH IS WHY THEY HAVE EDGES =====
 *
 * Two earlier attempts and why each looked wrong:
 *
 *  1. A per-texel area ratio measured in the SOURCE parameterization, gathered
 *     by walking back up the flat ray. Correct to first order, and it reads as
 *     soft mottling: caustics are bright because many parts of the surface focus
 *     onto the SAME place, and a gather can only report what one of them did.
 *  2. Point-splatting beams into an atomic accumulator. That sums folds, but the
 *     map is only as dense as the beams, so it needs a reconstruction filter,
 *     and the filter is exactly what removes the filaments again.
 *
 * The reference (MIT jeantimex/webgpu-water, itself a port of Evan Wallace's
 * pool) does neither: it DRAWS the refracted grid into the caustic texture. Each
 * vertex is projected to where its beam lands on the volume floor, and the
 * fragment reads the compression straight off the rasterizer as the ratio of the
 * undisturbed footprint to the drawn one — `length(dFdx) * length(dFdy)` of two
 * interpolants. Rasterization fills every texel a triangle covers, so there is
 * no sparsity and no filter; additive blending sums the folds, so a caustic is
 * bright exactly where several parts of the surface aim at one place. That is
 * the whole difference, and it is why this needs a draw call and not a kernel.
 *
 * The user asked for "the same texture the reference uses". It does not have
 * one: `public/` holds `tiles.jpg` and a skybox, and the caustics are computed
 * every frame from the live surface. This is that computation.
 *
 * THE MAP IS IN FLOOR PARAMETERIZATION - a receiver samples where its own beam
 * LANDS, not where it entered. See `waterCausticGainNode`.
