 * ══ THE WATER SURFACE'S OWN LOOK ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The planar mirror, foam, fine-scale normals and subsurface scattering — all
 * in one place because they land on the same handful of material slots and
 * three has exactly one of each. Two modules assigning `emissiveNode` would
 * silently clobber each other.
 *
 * ⛔⛔ **THE MIRROR WAS DELETED ONCE AND THAT WAS WRONG.** The scene appeared to
 * carry two reflections, one correct and one badly broken, and the broken one
 * was blamed on this. It was not: the ghosts were three's screen-space
 * TRANSMISSION, sampling the opaque scene at a refracted screen offset that
 * reached pixels of objects ABOVE the water (see `builtinMaterials.js`, where
 * `thickness` is now zero). This mirror was the CORRECT one all along —
 * measured at 1.5 px against the analytic mirror image, five separate times.
 * Deleting it left the water with no reflection whatever, because the traced
 * path cannot reach it either (`giLight.js`'s `giWater` early return, which is
 * load-bearing for a texture budget): "we had 2 reflections previously, one was
 * correct, and another one was broken. You killed both" (user, 2026-09-06).
 *
 * ⚠ The lesson is not about water. **A diagnosis offered by the person seeing
 * the bug is a hypothesis, not evidence.** "It is the water's own reflection"
 * fitted the symptom perfectly and was wrong, and acting on it deleted a
 * working subsystem instead of the faulty one standing next to it.
