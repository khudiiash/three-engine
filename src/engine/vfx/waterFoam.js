 * ══ WHAT A WATER SURFACE ADDS ON TOP OF BEING A MIRROR ═════════════════════
 *
 * Foam and subsurface scattering. Both land on material slots
 * `waterSurfaceLook.js` owns, which is why they are composed there — three has
 * exactly one `emissiveNode` and two modules writing it would silently clobber
 * each other. The fine-scale NORMAL used to live here too, as the slope of a
 * value-noise field; it is the spectral sea's derivative cascades now
 * (`waterSpectrum.js#seaShadingSlopeNode`) — real waves, not noise.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE READ THE SOLVER, NOT A SLOT. The engine-owned slots exist for
 * consumers that must not rebuild when a water surface changes (the medium,
 * GI); a material already rebuilds with its own water, so it may read the
 * simulation directly and get the authored wave settings with it.

/**
 * ══ FOAM ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ⭐ **FOAM IS ONE NUMBER PER POINT — HOW MUCH — AND THE LOOK IS A FUNCTION
 * OF THAT NUMBER.** The number comes from two places:
 *
 *  · THE SIMULATED FIELD (`gridSimulation.js`) — entrained by steep water, by
 *    crests two waves built between them, and by anything churning the
 *    surface; it spreads, persists and decays, so a patch drifts and dissolves
 *    instead of blinking with the wave that made it.
 *  · CONTACT — how close the opaque scene is behind this fragment. Not a
 *    property of water at all, just a depth comparison.
 *
 * What the number DRAWS is taken from the photographs (and the sea): fresh,
 * dense foam is a white SHEET with holes in it; as it thins it breaks into a
 * NETWORK of filaments along the boundaries of the cells the bubbles drain
 * into — the web every aerial photograph of a wake shows — and the last of it
 * is a scatter of single BUBBLES. So a high value draws the sheet, a middle
 * value the web, a low value specks; and because the field decays over a few
 * seconds, one patch goes through all three in order, sheet → web → specks,
 * which is what foam actually does.
 *
 * ⛔ THE PREVIOUS VERSION CARVED A BLOB FIELD WITH VALUE NOISE. Value noise
 * has structure at one scale per octave and no lines in it at all, so foam
 * came out as soft-edged white blotches at every strength ("it is not
 * realistic", user 2026-09-06, with a photograph of the network beside it).
 * The network is a Worley boundary, not a threshold on a blob.
 *
 * `foam` decides how much of the surface counts as foamy (it moves the
 * generation threshold in the solver) and gates this on or off; it is not a
 * dimmer, because half-transparent foam is a grey wash and not less foam.
