/**
 * ══ THE SPECTRAL SEA, ON THE GPU ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Popov72/OceanDemo's ocean (Babylon, MIT) rebuilt in TSL: a JONSWAP/TMA
 * spectrum realized once per settings change, evolved every frame by the
 * dispersion relation, inverse-transformed back to space and merged into the
 * three maps everything else reads — DISPLACEMENT (x, y, z, foam memory),
 * DERIVATIVES (the slopes the normal is built from) and, in `.w`, the JACOBIAN
 * TURBULENCE that says where the surface folded and how long ago.
 *
 * Three CASCADES tile the world at three length scales (250 : 17 : 5, hung
 * from the authored peak wavelength) so the swell, the wind chop and the
 * capillary texture each get a full 256² of spectrum. They tile in WORLD
 * metres, which is the whole point for this engine: the same sea state on a
 * 5 m pool and a 500 m lake, because neither knows how big its box is.
 *
 * `waterSpectrumCPU.js` is the specification: every formula here is the same
 * one, and `scripts/water-spectrum-smoke.html` diffs the two.
 *
 * ── THE TRANSFORM IS TWO DISPATCHES PER CASCADE, NOT SIXTEEN ──────────────
 *
 * Babylon runs log₂N ping-pong passes per direction — 32 tiny dispatches per
 * cascade per frame, which in three is 32 bind-group updates on the CPU
 * every frame. Here each workgroup owns one ROW (or column) in shared memory:
 * 128 threads load it bit-reversed, run the eight butterfly stages with a
 * barrier between them, and write it back. Both packed maps ride in the same
 * kernel, so a cascade's whole 2-D transform is `fftRows` + `fftCols`.
 *
 * ⚠ DISPATCHED BY WORKGROUP COUNT, NOT BY THREAD COUNT. `.compute(number)`
 * makes three prepend `if (index >= count) return;`, and a return before a
 * `workgroupBarrier()` is non-uniform control flow — the shader does not
 * compile. An ARRAY count is a dispatch size and adds no return.

 * ══ THE WHITECAP MEMORY (2026-09-07) ══════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * "Our default ocean looks pathetic" — a 500 m sea with soft foam blobs in
 * the 32 m ripple window and NOTHING beyond it. The per-pixel whitecap gate
 * (`seaFoamNode` on the composed Jacobian) is instantaneous and reads the
 * cascades at the pixel's own mip, and a filtered Jacobian averages toward 1:
 * past a few tens of metres the gate can never open, so the far sea is glass
 * while the reference (Popov72/OceanDemo) carries streaky foam to the
 * horizon. Its foam is a MEMORY — "turbulence", the Jacobian's deficit
 * integrated over seconds and decaying — and a memory mip-filters as a
 * COVERAGE, which is exactly what the distance needs.
 *
 * So the sea keeps one: a camera-following window of FOAM_WINDOW_METRES
 * (texel-snapped, like the caustic and ripple windows) over the COMPOSED
 * Jacobian — never per cascade, see the ⛔ below — where each texel holds
 * max(whitecap now, last frame's value × decay). A crest that folds leaves
 * a trail as it travels: the streaks. The lid reads it per pixel
 * (`waterFoam.js`) and per vertex (the solver's far-foam seed), the ripple
 * window's field remains the near-field memory a splash writes into.

 * whitecap coverage rule), live a random half-to-full lifetime, fade out,
 * and ride the SURFACE'S OWN HORIZONTAL VELOCITY (the time derivative of
 * the displacement, one more FFT per cascade): the filaments and holes of
 * real foam emerge from that advection alone. A hull's waterline hands the
