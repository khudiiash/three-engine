/**
 * ⭐⭐⭐ ONE GPU SUBMIT FOR EVERY CLOTH IN THE SCENE, NOT ONE EACH.
 *
 * `renderer.compute(kernels)` is not a cheap call. In three's WebGPU backend it
 * is a whole submission: `beginCompute` creates a command encoder AND a compute
 * pass, every kernel is encoded into it, and `finishCompute` ends the pass and
 * calls `device.queue.submit()`. Ten cloths each calling it from their own tick
 * therefore cost ten encoders, ten passes and TEN SUBMITS every frame — and in
 * Chromium a submit is a hop to the GPU process, so its cost lands nowhere any
 * clock inside the page can see it.
 *
 * That is exactly the shape the user measured with `profile.frameCensus` on
 * 2026-09-09: cloth priced at **22.92 ms of a 31.25 ms frame** while its main
 * thread read 1.3 ms and its timestamped GPU passes read ~3 ms. The frame was
 * waiting on submissions, and the profiler called the wait idle.
 *
 * Cloths are independent, so the ORDER of one cloth's kernels relative to
 * another's does not matter — only the order WITHIN a cloth, which
 * concatenation preserves exactly. WebGPU orders dispatches inside a pass and
 * makes each one's writes visible to the next, which is the same guarantee the
 * solver's ping-pong already relies on.
 *
 * ⚠ WATER IS NOT BATCHED. Its queue is interleaved with a nested
 * `renderer.render` for caustics and with `spectrum.afterCompute`, and the
 * ordering of those against the compute encoder is load-bearing — issuing the
 * caustic draw inside the compute encoding poisoned the object bind group and
 * failed every water pipeline (2026-09-05). Cloth has no such coupling.
