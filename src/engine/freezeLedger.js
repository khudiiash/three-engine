/**
 * THE FREEZE LEDGER — every main-thread block, with an owner.
 *
 * ⭐ WHY THIS EXISTS (docs/ZERO_FREEZE_PLAN.md §3 R5). Until this file, the
 * editor recorded nothing about its own freezes. Every one the user reported
 * — a 10-120 s boot, a 10 s click, a param change that hangs — was
 * reconstructed days later from console archaeology, and several of those
 * reconstructions were wrong (see the ledgers: "the reflect HOLD held a trace
 * that never ran", "the lit marker lied by 22 s"). A freeze the instrument
 * cannot name is a freeze nobody can fix, and a mean cannot see one:
 * `profile.cpuFrame` reports a healthy 14 ms for a drag with a 300 ms hitch
 * every second.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. A `PerformanceObserver('longtask')` — the browser's own report
 * of "the main thread was blocked for N ms" — joined to a ring of ACTIVITY
 * SPANS the engine records as it works. The observer fires after the task, so
 * attribution is an overlap query against spans that are already closed:
 * nothing needs to guess, and nothing on the hot path allocates.
 *
 * SELF TIME, NOT TOTAL. Spans nest (`gi:rebuild` contains `gi:staticBvh`
 * contains `gpu:shaderModule`), so a naive overlap sum reports 300 % of the
 * task. Each span subtracts its direct children's total from its own, exactly
 * as a sampling profiler's self time works, and attribution reads `selfMs`.
 * A block therefore reads as ONE name plus the frames above it, which is what
 * "who froze the editor" means.
 *
 * COST WHEN NOTHING IS FREEZING. `begin`/`end` are two `performance.now()`
 * calls and a push/pop on a preallocated stack; a span shorter than
 * `MIN_SPAN_MS` is dropped without touching the ring. There is no allocation
 * per span and no string work until a report is read. The observer itself is
 * a browser-side thing that only calls back when the thread actually blocked.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ONE FAILURE MODE, same as StatsSystem's phase marks: an UNMARKED
 * block does not read as zero, it reads as `(unattributed)`. That is
 * deliberate — an honest hole beats a wrong name — but it means adding a
 * heavy new stage without a mark makes the ledger quietly less useful. Mark
 * the stage in the same commit that adds it.

/**
 * Spans INSIDE three's render, so a `frame:renderEncode` block can say which
 * half of the render it was.
 *
 * 2026-09-09, after a light's castShadow flip: `[freeze] 475 ms —
 * frame:renderEncode 433.5, gpu:writeBuffer 36.7` with no node build in it.
 * The render is one span from the outside, and inside it are at least five
 * different owners with five different fixes: the shadow-map pass (a nested
 * `_renderScene` into the shadow target), bind-group creation for re-created
 * render objects, texture uploads, geometry uploads, and the per-object
 * `updateBefore` hooks (skinning, instancing, and the shadow node's own
 * render). Each is a few calls per object per frame, so a span costs two
 * `performance.now()`s and nothing reaches the ring below the 0.4 ms floor.
