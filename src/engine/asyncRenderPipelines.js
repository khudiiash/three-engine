// ASYNC RENDER PIPELINES FOR THE MAIN SCENE RENDER — the freeze class named
// by `probe:gi-boot-frames` and `probe:camera-motion` on 2026-09-02, and the
// 21.5-SECOND block the freeze ledger recorded on 2026-09-09.
//
// three creates a render pipeline SYNCHRONOUSLY the first time an object with
// a new (material, geometry layout, render context) is drawn:
// `Pipelines.getForRender(renderObject)` → `_getRenderPipeline(…, promises =
// null)` → `device.createRenderPipeline(desc)`. In Chrome the call returns at
// once, but the GPU process executes it IN ORDER on its command thread, so a
// 170 kB GI-injected material shader parks that thread for its whole compile
// and every later command from this page — including the flow-control ack the
// renderer's main thread is waiting on — queues behind it. The page's main
// thread then blocks for the length of the compile, inside a task the ledger
// reports as `(unattributed)` with no engine span and no wrapped WebGPU call
// in it. Measured on the user's Level: 28 sync pipelines at first paint =
// 1.1–1.2 s frozen; 29 at the first lit frame = 2.4 s; NINE on a camera drag
// (7 of them lit-material variants first seen when the camera turned) =
// 1.19 s — the "heavy freezes on launch and after I move the camera" report.
// And on 2026-09-09, on the user's Foliage scene: ten synchronous re-mints of
// a 70 kB foliage program (a `lights` wave after a light edit, then the
// environment latch, then the ambient-glow context) parked the GPU process for
// **21 528 ms** in one block, `(unattributed) 21528`, `gpu: null`.
//
// three already owns the fix and uses it in `compileAsync`: hand the backend a
// promises array and `createRenderPipelineAsync` compiles on the driver's
// worker threads while `Renderer._renderObjectDirect` SKIPS the draw
// (`Pipelines.isReady` is false until the promise lands). Nothing blocks; the
// object appears the frame its pipeline is ready. This module turns that path
// on for the ENGINE'S MAIN RENDER, and adds the one thing three's path lacks —
// a re-minted object keeps drawing what it drew before until its replacement
// is ready — so that NO pipeline has to be created synchronously inside the
// frame, first compile or re-mint.
//
//   · scope — `active` is raised by Engine around the one call that presents
//     the frame (the scene render, or the postprocess override's). A one-shot
//     render outside it (an atlas tile blit, an impostor bake, a texture
//     average readback, the editor's picking/outline passes) keeps the sync
//     path for a FIRST compile, because a skipped draw there is a black result
//     nobody re-renders — the exact failure class of
//     gi-atlas-blit-cleared-itself.
//   · size — a FIRST compile goes async only when the LARGER of the two
//     programs is at least `minFragmentBytes` of WGSL. Shadow-depth materials
//     (~1 kB), the GI gbuffer overrides (~1.5 kB), unlit materials (~4 kB)
//     compile in a few ms and are not worth a frame of absence; lit materials
//     without GI are ~27 kB, with GI 170–250 kB, and those are the stalls.
//     A RE-MINT that has something to draw meanwhile ignores the gate: there
//     is no absence to trade, so even a small program goes async.
//
//     ⛔ AND DO NOT ADD A "NESTED RENDERS STAY SYNC" RULE ON RENDER DEPTH.
//     It is the obvious guard and it is wrong here: with a Postprocess
//     component the SCENE render is nested by construction (RenderPipeline →
//     QuadMesh.render → PassNode.updateBefore → renderer.render), so a depth
//     rule would send exactly the heavy lit materials back down the blocking
//     path on the scenes that need this most. The one-shot renders the scope
//     rule protects — atlas blits, impostor bakes, picking, the outline mask —
//     run from preRender/postRender where `active` is already false. A nested
//     pass that DOES ride inside the main render (a planar reflection, a water
//     mirror) re-renders every frame, so a deferred pipeline costs it one
//     frame, not a permanent black.
//
//     ⚠ IT USED TO READ THE FRAGMENT ALONE, and the freeze ledger caught what
//     that misses (2026-09-07, the user's Pool scene): `[freeze] 175 ms —
//     (unattributed) 175 [sync gpu: 17r/0c/2m, 78kB WGSL]` — seventeen render
//     pipelines built synchronously from two ~39 kB programs. A displaced
//     water surface, a skinned mesh and every vertex-animated material carry
//     their weight in the VERTEX stage, where the old gate read a fragment of
//     a few kB and sent them all down the blocking path. The driver compiles
//     both stages either way, so both have to be looked at.
//
// ══ THE RE-MINT: "DRAW THE PREVIOUS PROGRAM UNTIL THE NEW ONE LANDS" ═════════
//
// 2026-09-07 the rule was "defer a FIRST compile, never a RE-MINT": deferring
// an object that is on screen swaps it for a hole ("every mesh I select
// disappears for a moment"), so re-mints were compiled synchronously and the
// hitch was accepted. 2026-09-09 the ledger priced that hitch at 21.5 s on a
// scene with ten re-minted foliage programs, and the standing rule of this
// project is NO FREEZE. So the trade is now refused on both sides: a re-mint
// is compiled asynchronously AND the object keeps drawing what it drew before.
// three re-mints in two different shapes and each needs its own stand-in:
//
//   · SAME render object, new pipeline — `WebGPUBackend.needsRenderUpdate`
//     fires on a render-state change (side, blending, depth, alphaToCoverage,
//     the target's sample count) and `Pipelines.getForRender` mints a new
//     pipeline from the SAME two programs. Same programs means the same bind
//     group layout, so the previous pipeline is still valid against this
//     object's bindings: `renderObject.pipeline` is pointed back at it (that is
//     the field `backend.draw` reads) until the new one is ready. This is the
//     case the 2026-09-07 note rejected with "bind groups are rebuilt for the
//     new pipeline's layout" — which is true only of the OTHER shape.
//   · NEW render object — a material cache-key change or a scene-wide input
//     to three's dynamic key (`lights`, `environment`, `fog`, `shadowMap`, the
//     context node) makes `RenderObjects.get` DISPOSE the render object and
//     build a fresh one: new node graph, new bindings, new pipeline. The old
//     one's pipeline, bindings and graph are consistent WITH EACH OTHER, so the
//     whole object is PARKED instead of deleted (its chain-map entry is
//     removed, which is what lets `get` create the replacement; the three
//     resource deletes are deferred), and while the replacement's pipeline is
//     compiling `Pipelines.isReady` draws the parked object in its place —
//     uniforms refreshed, bindings updated, `backend.draw` — and reports the
//     new one as not ready. The first frame the new pipeline is ready the
//     parked object is released.
//
//     What a parked object does NOT get is `Nodes.updateBefore`: that is where
//     a `ShadowNode` re-renders its shadow map, and the parked graph may hold
//     the OLD light's shadow node. Skinning and instancing survive without it
//     because the bone texture and instance buffer are shared with the live
//     object, whose own `updateBefore` still runs.
//
//     A parked object is drawn only while every texture and storage buffer it
//     binds still exists on the backend (`parkedDrawable`) — the old light's
//     disposed shadow map is the case — and while its material and geometry
//     are alive; otherwise it is dropped and the object is absent for the
//     compile, which is exactly what the async path did before. A chain of
//     quick re-mints hands the parked object down to the newest replacement,
//     and a parked object older than `PARKED_TTL_MS` is released on the next
//     install call (once per frame) so a culled object cannot pin one forever.
//
// What changes for the user: the first frame of a scene shows objects filling
// in over the driver's compile time instead of the whole editor freezing for
// it; turning the camera onto a never-seen material costs a few frames of
// that object being absent instead of a >1 s hitch; a light or material edit
// re-mints every affected program on the driver's threads while the old
// picture stays up, and the new one replaces it the frame it lands.
//
// `globalThis.__asyncRenderPipelines = false` restores the sync path whole
// (the A/B arm); `__asyncRenderPipelinesMinBytes` moves the size gate;
// `__asyncRenderPipelinesStandIn = false` restores the 2026-09-07 rule (a
// re-mint compiles synchronously, no stand-in, no parking) and
// `__asyncRenderPipelinesRemint = true` the 2026-09-02 one (defer everything,
// holes and all) — the two arms for pricing what each trade costs.

/**
 * How much node-graph BUILD time one frame of the main render may spend
 * before the remaining unbuilt objects wait for the next frame.
 *
 * ══ THE BUILD BUDGET ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * With the driver compile off the main thread, what is left of a re-mint
 * wave is three's `nodeBuilder.build()` — the TSL graph walk and WGSL codegen,
 * 20-60 ms per lit material on the user's machine and 250-400 ms per wave of
 * nine (`[freeze] 362 ms — material:nodeBuild Foliage · living surface 255
 * … [rebuilt: lights x9]`, 2026-09-09). It runs synchronously inside
 * `renderer.render`, the first time an object with a new program is drawn, so
 * a wave is one block. The plan's unit 2.2 asks for "≤ 8 ms of build per
 * frame while the user interacts", and parking makes that possible without a
 * hole: an object whose graph is not built yet keeps drawing its PARKED
 * predecessor, exactly as one whose pipeline is still compiling does. So the
 * main render builds graphs until the frame's budget is spent and defers the
 * rest — a nine-material wave becomes ~9 frames of one build each instead of
 * one 360 ms frame. At least one build always goes through per frame, so the
 * wave never stalls; a first compile with nothing parked is simply absent
 * for those frames, which it was anyway while its pipeline compiled.
 *
 * Only the main render is budgeted (`state.active`): a one-shot pass wants its
 * objects now. An object whose program another object already built
 * (`nodeBuilderCache` hit) is not a build and is never deferred.
 * `__asyncRenderPipelinesBuildBudgetMs` moves it; `0` disables the budget.

  //   THREE.WebGPURenderer: [Buffer "bindingBuffer72_render_(vertex,fragment,

  //
  // `Bindings` refcounts every bind group in `usedTimes`: `_createBindings`
  // increments (once per render object, from its first `updateForRender`), and

  // Most groups are cloned per render object, but a SHARED one is not:
  // `NodeBuilderState.createBindings` hands every render object in a render
  // context the SAME `render`/`frame` BindGroup, so its `usedTimes` is "how
  // many render objects exist in this context" — buffer 72 above is that
  // shared `render` group, bound by the whole scene.
  //
  // `deleteForRender` decrements UNCONDITIONALLY: three assumes a disposed
  // render object was drawn at least once. The build budget below breaks that
  // assumption — it calls `_objects.get()`, which CREATES and registers the
  // render object, and then returns without drawing it, so the object never
  // reaches `Bindings.getForRender` and increments nothing. Re-key it before
  // its deferred build lands (on a scene whose dynamic cache key moves every
  // frame, that is every frame) and its dispose decrements the shared group
  // for an increment that never happened. A few hundred of those and
  // `usedTimes` hits zero while the entire scene is still drawing with it:
  // `destroyUniformBuffer` runs, and the next frame is the pair above.
  //
  // The guard is the invariant three's own code states and only assumes:
  // destroy exactly what was created. An uninitialized render object drops its
  // DataMap entry and nothing else. It also saves the node build the delete
  // would otherwise force — `deleteForRender` reaches `renderObject
