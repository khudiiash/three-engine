/**
 * Automatic shadow-map freezing — stop re-rendering a shadow map for a scene
 * that has not moved.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A shadow map is a full extra submission of every shadow-casting mesh, from
 * the light's frustum rather than the camera's — so it is NOT reduced by
 * frustum culling of the view, and on a large scene it is routinely the biggest
 * draw consumer in the frame. Measured on Bistro (2026-08-17), after static
 * merging cut the main pass to 88 draws:
 *
 * | pass | draws |
 * |---|---|
 * | `ShadowMap:2048x2048#` | **459** |
 * | main opaque | 88 |
 * | depth prepass | 87 |
 *
 * **Seventy percent of the frame's draw calls were the shadow map**, redrawn
 * every frame for a static street under a static sun. The frame was CPU-bound on
 * submission (`renderEncode` 20.7 ms of a 28.2 ms tick), so that is 70 % of the
 * dominant cost being spent to reproduce an identical texture.
 *
 * ## Why it is automatic, when a manual switch already existed
 *
 * `shadow.autoUpdate` is real and Scene Settings exposes it, but a manual freeze
 * puts the invalidation burden on the author: freeze it and every later edit
 * silently renders with a stale shadow, which is a much worse bug than a slow
 * frame because it looks like a lighting mistake. So the switch was, correctly,
 * left on — and the cost was paid forever.
 *
 * A fingerprint takes neither horn. `godraysShadow.js` established the pattern
 * for exactly this problem one system over; this is the same idea applied to the
 * map that costs the most.
 *
 * ## The conservative rule
 *
 * The fingerprint returns `null` — read as "never freeze" — the moment it sees
 * geometry whose SILHOUETTE can change while its world matrix does not. Skinned
 * meshes and morph targets deform in the vertex shader, so no property this walk
 * can read moves when the shadow should. A miss here is a stale shadow, which is
 * a visible artifact and not a crash, so the rule is deliberately biased towards
 * doing the work.
 *
 * ⚠ A directional light's shadow camera TRACKS THE VIEW CAMERA (LightComponent
 * recentres it). With a one-texel snap that invalidated the map on every camera
 * nudge; LightComponent now snaps to `shadowCamSnap` world units (default 0.5)
 * and skips rewriting matrices inside a cell, so ShadowFreeze can stay engaged
 * while orbiting. Crossing a snap cell still redraws — that is correct: the
 * shadow volume really moved. The win is between steps, and on a parked camera.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ NEVER FINGERPRINT A VALUE THIS SYSTEM'S OWN OUTPUT GATES. The per-light
 * key must be built from inputs three refreshes unconditionally (world
 * matrices, authored parameters), never from state that only advances when the
 * shadow renders — `shadow.camera.matrixWorldInverse` is exactly that, and
 * using it froze every rotating light permanently. Full postmortem at the mix
 * site in `update()`.
 */

/**
 * Hash of everything that feeds a shadow map, or `null` for "never freeze".
 *
 * A rolling integer hash, not a joined string: this runs every frame over the
 * whole scene, and allocating hundreds of short-lived strings to save draw calls
 * would just move the cost onto the garbage collector — the exact mistake
 * `merging.js`' watchers were amortised to undo. Values are rounded to 1e-4 so
 * float jitter in a matrix recomputed every frame from unchanged inputs does not
 * read as motion.
 *
 * A collision costs ONE stale frame until the next real change, which is why a
 * hash is acceptable here and would not be for a cache key.

 * Every shadow caster in the scene whose map this system can actually stop.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS IS NOT `object.isLight`, AND THAT COST THE WHOLE OPTIMISATION.
 *
 * The gate this system writes is `shadow.autoUpdate`, and the only code that
 * reads it is `ShadowNode.updateBefore` (three r185, ShadowNode.js:855):
 *
 *     let needsUpdate = shadow.needsUpdate || shadow.autoUpdate;
 *     if ( needsUpdate ) this.updateShadow( frame );   // <- renders the map
 *
 * So the question is never "is this a light" — it is **"does a plain
 * `ShadowNode` own this map"**. Two cases break the naive answer, and CSM
 * manages to be both at once:
 *
 * 1. **A custom `shadow.shadowNode` means three SKIPS `ShadowNode` entirely.**
 *    `AnalyticLightNode.setupShadow` takes the custom node and never calls
 *    `setupShadowNode()`, so nothing reads `autoUpdate` and freezing such a
 *    light is a silent no-op. Both of this project's custom nodes land here:
 *    GI-traced shadows and `CSMShadowNode`.
 * 2. **A CSM cascade is NOT a Light.** `CSMShadowNode._init` builds one
 *    `class LwLight extends Object3D` per cascade — `castShadow = true`, a
 *    real cloned `DirectionalLightShadow`, wrapped in a real TSL
 *    `shadow(lwLight, lShadow)` node, and added to the scene graph by
 *    `updateBefore`. It carries **no `isLight`**, because it is an Object3D.
 *
 * Together those two produced a total, silent failure: an `object.isLight`
 * filter found ONLY the CSM parent — whose flag nothing reads (case 1) — and
 * never the cascades, which are the objects that actually own the maps and DO
 * honour the flag (case 2). Measured on Bistro (2026-08-24, 2 cascades at
 * 4096²): **842 of the frame's 1144 draws and 4.5M triangles re-rendered every
 * frame on a parked camera over static geometry**, ~46 ms of a 63 ms
 * `renderEncode` on an 83 ms CPU frame. `frozenLights` reported 1 the whole
 * time — a freeze that owned a light it could not stop.
 *
 * The predicate below therefore asks the structural question directly: it takes
 * anything that carries its own `shadow.camera` (that is what a map is rendered
 * from) and rejects anything whose map a custom node owns.
