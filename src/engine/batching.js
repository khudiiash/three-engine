/**
 * Automatic static batching.
 *
 * A mesh entity is one `THREE.Mesh`, and every `THREE.Mesh` is one draw call —
 * re-issued again for each shadow cascade. A scene assembled from an imported
 * model is thousands of entities that overwhelmingly repeat a handful of
 * distinct (geometry, material) pairs, so the frame becomes CPU-bound on draw
 * submission long before the GPU is doing anything interesting.
 *
 * This system finds meshes that share a geometry AND a material (and agree on
 * the render flags that have to be uniform across a draw) and renders each such
 * group as a single `InstancedMesh`. A thousand crates become one draw call.
 *
 * The member meshes are NOT removed from the scene graph — they are only made
 * invisible. That is deliberate and load-bearing:
 *
 *   - three's Raycaster tests `layers`, never `visible`, so editor picking,
 *     selection outlines and bounds keep working against the real per-entity
 *     meshes with no special-casing anywhere in the editor.
 *   - the batch proxies opt OUT of raycasting (`raycast = () => {}`) so a click
 *     resolves to exactly one entity, exactly as before.
 *   - anything that walks the scene for a component's own mesh still finds it.
 *
 * "Static" refers to topology, not to motion: a member that MOVES is cheap
 * (its instance matrix is rewritten in place), a member that is ADDED, REMOVED,
 * HIDDEN or RE-MATERIALED forces its group to be rebuilt.
