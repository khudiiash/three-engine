 * Runs user scripts against this entity. One component holds a LIST of scripts
 * (PlayCanvas's model), because an entity routinely needs several unrelated
 * behaviours — health, input, a spawner — and splitting those across files is
 * how anyone actually writes gameplay code.
 *
 * The alternative would have been letting an entity hold several `script`
 * components. That is Unity's model, but `Entity.components` is a Map keyed by
 * type and `addComponent` throws on a duplicate, so it would mean teaching the
 * registry, the inspector, serialization and the prefab differ about
 * N-of-a-type. A list inside one component gets the same capability without
 * touching any of that.
 *
 * A script module default-exports a class (or plain object) with optional
 * `onStart()` / `onUpdate(dt)` / `onDestroy()` / `onHotReload(old)` hooks, plus
 * whatever hooks other systems dispatch (physics sends `onCollisionEnter` and
 * friends; the UI button sends `onClick`). Scripts get `entity` / `engine` /
 * `THREE` / `input` injected rather than importing engine internals.
 *
 * Lifecycle only runs while `engine.playing` is true — editing a scene with
 * scripts attached doesn't execute game logic. Files are still polled and
 * re-imported on change regardless of play state, so edits are picked up as
 * soon as Play starts.
 *
 * ## Edit-mode scripts
 *
 * The exception is a class marked `@executeInEditMode` (see `editorBridge.js`),
 * Unity's `[ExecuteInEditMode]`. Those get their lifecycle and an
 * `onEditorUpdate(dt)` tick while the editor is stopped, which is how a script
 * can act as an authoring tool — procedurally laying out children, keeping a
 * spline in sync, drawing gizmos. `onUpdate` still fires only while playing, so
 * gameplay code never runs against the scene you are editing.
 *
 * Two hooks are dispatched outside the running gate entirely, because they are
 * editor surface rather than behaviour: `onDrawGizmos(gizmos)` (called by the
 * editor's gizmo pass for every loaded script) and `@menuItem`-decorated
 * methods (registered as menu entries as soon as the instance exists).
 *
 * ## props shape
 *
 *   { scripts: [{ path, enabled, attributes }] }
 *
 * Array order is execution order, and it's user-visible: the inspector can
 * reorder slots. `enabled` is per script, so one behaviour can be switched off
 * without detaching the others or losing its tuned attribute values.
