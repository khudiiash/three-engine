/**
 * True mirror reflections for a FLAT surface — a polished floor, a still pool,
 * a wall mirror.
 *
 * This is the first tier of the reflection plan (docs/GI_PLAN.md): a planar
 * surface is the one case where a reflection can be *exact and cheap at the
 * same time*, because the whole surface shares one mirrored camera. Screen-
 * space reflections cannot show anything that is off-screen or behind the
 * viewer — which on a floor is most of what you would see in it — and the GI
 * mirror trace resolves the scene only as well as its field. Reflecting the
 * scene through the plane has neither limit: it is the real geometry, from the
 * mirrored viewpoint, at whatever resolution you pay for.
 *
 * ## The cost, stated plainly
 *
 * One extra render of the scene per reflector, per frame. That is the deal
 * planar reflections make everywhere they are used, and it is why this is a
 * component you place deliberately rather than a material checkbox: two of
 * these on screen means three scene renders. `resolution` is the dial — a
 * mirror is high-frequency detail seen through a Fresnel falloff, so half
 * resolution is usually indistinguishable and a quarter of the fill cost.
 *
 * ## Which way the surface faces
 *
 * `normalAxis` is the entity's LOCAL axis pointing out of the reflective face,
 * and it defaults to `+Z` because that is where a `plane` primitive's normal
 * points before you rotate it flat (three's own `PlaneGeometry` lies in XY).
 * For the top face of a box slab, that is `+Y`. Get this wrong and the
 * reflection simply does not draw — the reflector treats a surface viewed from
 * behind as having nothing to show.
 *
 * ## Arbitration with GI
 *
 * A smooth floor is also in GI's mirror roughness bucket, so without this the
 * surface would show a planar reflection AND a traced one, blended by nothing
 * in particular. While attached, the component marks its materials
 * `userData.planarReflection`, which GI reads at two points: `giLight` compiles
 * no reflection path for them, and `GISystem` leaves them out of the exact
 * reflection prepass's mirror mask (so they cost it no rays either). Planar
 * wins on the surfaces it owns; GI keeps everything else.
