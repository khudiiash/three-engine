    // to share one dropdown — which meant "I want exact triangles" could only
    // be said by ALSO declaring the object a mover. That conflation is what
    // put 30 static Sponza meshes into the per-ray mover loop (2026-08-06).
    //
    // giMobility — "auto": voxelized while it sits still, adopted into the
    // exact ray-traced mover path on first motion (and demoted back after a
    // long rest in edit mode). "static": never adopt — it stays in the voxel
    // field for radiance and in the world static shadow BVH, which ALREADY
    // gives it exact triangle shadows. "dynamic": adopt at load without
    // waiting for motion. Every mover is tested by every ray, so "dynamic"
    // is the expensive one — use it for things that actually move.
    giMobility: "auto",
    // giTrace — the surface a ray intersects once this mesh IS a mover.
    // "auto": by geometry (three.js primitives with a closed form → analytic
    // sphere/capsule/frustum/OBB, everything else → exact triangle BVH).
    // "bvh": force exact triangles. "obb": force the bounding box (cheapest).
    // "voxel": never go exact — keep the voxel path even while moving.
    // Ignored while giMobility is "static": static surfaces are already exact.
    giTrace: "auto",
    // giProxy — the shape this mesh casts INDIRECT light and shadow with while
    // it is a mover. Different question from `giTrace`, which is what a ray
    // intersects; this is what the DIFFUSE field is told the object looks like.
    //
    // Why the two differ. Diffuse transport samples a small fixed set of
    // directions, so testing a mover's real triangles is a hit-or-miss coin flip
    // that re-flips every time the object turns — the "light randomly blinks
    // when an object moves" artifact. A mover is therefore removed from those
    // rays entirely and re-enters as a CLOSED FORM (cascadeGather's
    // sphereOcclusion, which doubles as the form factor for its bounce). Closed
    // forms are continuous in the transform, so a rotating proxy is analytically
    // a no-op — which is exactly what the eye expects and what sampling could
    // never deliver.
    //
    // The shader only ever evaluates SPHERES — exact, ~20 ALU, no branching —
    // so a proxy is spent as a number of spheres rather than a new formula:
    //   "auto"    fit from bounds. ONE continuous formula: spheres along the
    //             longest axis, whose count and offset fall to a single
    //             bounding sphere as the shape becomes compact. No threshold,
    //             so a character whose AABB shifts as its limbs move cannot pop
    //             between two fits. Right for a crate and a character alike.
    //   "sphere"  force one bounding sphere. Exact for ball-like movers, and
    //             the cheapest option at one slot.
    //   "capsule" force the multi-sphere fit even when the pose is momentarily
    //             compact — the character setting. A capsule is the standard
    //             stand-in for a humanoid and keeps a walking figure's shadow
    //             from ballooning to a sphere its full height. Also right for
    //             planks and slabs; the fit is the same formula.

    //             tiny movers whose GI contribution is not worth any slots.
