/**
 * Base class for all components. Subclasses must define:
 *   static type       — unique string id ("mesh", "light", ...)
 *   static label      — display name for the editor
 *   static defaults   — default props object
 *   static schema     — property descriptors used by the inspector:
 *                       [{ key, label, type: "number"|"color"|"select"|"text"|"boolean",
 *                          min?, max?, step?, options? }]
 * and may override onAttach/onDetach/onPropChanged.
 *
 * Constructed with just `props` — `new MeshComponent({ geometry: "sphere" })`
 * — and has no entity until `Entity.addComponent` attaches it (`onAttach()`
 * runs at that point, not in the constructor).
 *
 * Subclasses may also set:
 *   static tags       — short string array of free-form editor tags, used by
 *                       the Modules panel to filter / group components
 *                       (e.g. ["physics", "play-mode", "3d"]). Pure metadata;
 *                       never read by the runtime.
 *
 * Every component has two built-in meta-toggles (default true). They are
 * not part of `schema` — the inspector renders them in the section header
 * alongside the existing eye (enabled) and remove buttons.
 *
 *   - `enabled` — when false, the component stops contributing to the
 *     runtime (no rendering, no ticking) without being detached. Data and
 *     three.js objects are preserved so toggling back on restores state.
 *
 *   - `viewOnly` — when true, the component's runtime work pauses while
 *     its entity is outside the camera frustum. Re-enabled the moment
 *     the entity re-enters. Designed to win more performance than it
 *     spends: see `viewFrustum.js` for the per-frame cost analysis.
 *
 * To opt into enabled, subclasses override `onDisable()` / `onEnable()`.
 * To opt into viewOnly, subclasses gate their `#tick` / per-frame work
 * behind `this.isInView()` (or `if (!this.viewOnly || this.isInView())`).
 *
 * Extends `EventEmitter` for local, per-instance pub-sub — every component
 * gets `changed`/`destroyed` for free (see `ComponentEventMap` in
 * engine.d.ts), fired from `setProp` and `Entity.removeComponent` below. A
 * subclass with its own events (e.g. `TimelineComponent`'s `finished`)
 * just calls `this.emit(...)`; its own `.d.ts` interface types the payload
 * via `ComponentBase<Props, OwnEventMap>`.
