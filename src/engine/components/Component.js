/**
 * Base class for all components. Subclasses must define:
 *   static type       — unique string id ("mesh", "light", ...)
 *   static label      — display name for the editor
 *   static defaults   — default props object
 *   static schema     — property descriptors used by the inspector:
 *                       [{ key, label, type: "number"|"color"|"select"|"text"|"boolean",
 *                          min?, max?, step?, options? }]
 * and may override onAttach/onDetach/onPropChanged.
 *
 * Every component has two built-in meta-toggles (default true). They are
 * not part of `schema` — the inspector renders them in the section header
 * alongside the existing eye (enabled) and remove buttons.
 *
 *   - `enabled` — when false, the component stops contributing to the
 *     runtime (no rendering, no ticking) without being detached. Data and
 *     three.js objects are preserved so toggling back on restores state.
 *
 *   - `viewOnly` — when true, the component's runtime work pauses while
 *     its entity is outside the camera frustum. Re-enabled the moment
 *     the entity re-enters. Designed to win more performance than it
 *     spends: see `viewFrustum.js` for the per-frame cost analysis.
 *
 * To opt into enabled, subclasses override `onDisable()` / `onEnable()`.
 * To opt into viewOnly, subclasses gate their `#tick` / per-frame work
 * behind `this.isInView()` (or `if (!this.viewOnly || this.isInView())`).
