 * Version 1 files were flat — `states`/`transitions`/`startTransitions` at the
 * top level, one implicit layer. `normalizeGraph` folds those into a single
 * "Base Layer" on load, so old controllers keep working untouched and are
 * upgraded in place the next time the Animator panel saves.
 *
 * The `__start__` pseudo-state is the entrance to a layer's graph. Drag a wire
 * from the Start node to a state to declare it the default entry — the first
 * Start→X transition whose conditions pass (against parameter defaults) wins;
 * without any, the runtime falls back to the first state in the list.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this owns action weights instead of using crossFadeTo()
 *
 * three's `crossFadeTo`/`fadeIn` schedule weight interpolants inside the mixer.
 * That is fine for one state machine, but layers need the *composed* weight of
 * every contributing action to be exact — an override layer at weight 1 must
 * fully replace the base layer, and the mixer's per-track normalisation only
 * produces that if the numbers going in are right. So transitions here are
 * timed by the runtime and written with `setEffectiveWeight` each frame. It
 * also makes blend trees possible at all: their children's weights change every
 * frame from a parameter, which no scheduled interpolant can express.
 */

 *
 *   base region "arms" = (1 - wAim)    aim layer = wAim
