 * ⛔ NEVER LET THREE FALL BACK TO WebGL ON A CANVAS THAT WAS WebGPU.
 *
 * three installs `getFallback` inside the WebGPURenderer constructor — it
 * overwrites whatever the caller passes — so ANY failure inside `init()`,
 * including `requestDevice` running out of GPU memory, is retried as
 * `new WebGLBackend(...)`. A canvas that has already handed out a WebGPU
 * context returns null for `getContext('webgl2')` by spec, so that second
 * attempt dies on `getSupportedExtensions` of null, and THAT is the error the
 * caller sees. The real cause is gone.
 *
 * Observed exactly this on a live device loss (2026-09-07): four rebuild
 * attempts all reported "Cannot read properties of null (reading
 * 'getSupportedExtensions')" while the actual message —
 * `ID3D12Device::CreateDescriptorHeap failed with E_OUTOFMEMORY` — reached
 * only the raw console. Clearing the hook makes `init()` reject with the
 * original error, which is both the truth and the only thing the retry can
 * make a decision from.
 *
 * A canvas that was never WebGPU (an explicit `forceWebGL` build) keeps its
 * fallback: there the WebGL backend is the point, not a trap.
 *
 * @param {object} renderer A freshly constructed WebGPURenderer.
 * @param {boolean} wasWebGPU Whether the canvas previously held a WebGPU context.

   * rebuild systems (batching, merging, shadow merging, impostors, occlusion)
