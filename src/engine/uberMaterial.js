/**
 * One material for many materials.
 *
 * Static merging (see `merging.js`) can concatenate any number of geometries
 * into one buffer, but a single draw call can bind exactly one material — so the
 * merge is only worth anything if the materials collapse too. They cannot be
 * collapsed by picking one: what actually differs between two Sponza materials
 * is which texture they bind and a handful of scalars.
 *
 * So this builds the material the merged geometry needs: every source texture
 * becomes a LAYER of a `DataArrayTexture`, every source scalar becomes an entry
 * in a small uniform array, and the merged geometry carries a per-vertex
 * `materialIndex` that selects both. N bind groups become one.
 *
 * ## Layers are not resampled
 *
 * A texture array demands one size for every layer, and rescaling a source map
 * to fit is a visible change to the user's art. This module therefore never
 * rescales: a group is formed only from materials whose textures already agree
 * on size and wrapping (`slotSignature` is what enforces it), and the caller
 * splits mismatched ones into separate groups. The one image this module
 * synthesises is the neutral fill for a material that has no texture in a slot
 * its group-mates do use — white for colour, flat +Z for normals — which is
 * exactly the value the shader would have used anyway.
 *
 * ## Only stock PBR
 *
 * `isUberCompatible` refuses any material carrying a custom node slot. A
 * node-graph material's colour is an arbitrary expression, and there is no
 * "index" that could select between two of them — the only materials whose
 * differences are DATA rather than CODE are the stock-PBR ones that
 * `materialAsset.js` produces for imported PBR (`applyStockPbr`). Those are the
 * 32-of-46 same-structure imports that made this worth building.
 */

 * Node slots that turn a material's shading into code rather than data. Any one

 *

 * so three's observer refreshes uniforms every frame), and it contributes
 * nothing to the shading graph. Treating it as a custom slot would make every
 * material in a GI scene unmergeable — which is every scene this exists for.
