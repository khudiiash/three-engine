/**
 * Resolves the bare specifiers user scripts import.
 *
 * A script is loaded by fetching its source, transpiling it, and importing it
 * from a `blob:` URL. Bare specifiers (`"engine"`, `"three"`) mean nothing to
 * the browser in that context, and `blob:` is a non-hierarchical scheme, so
 * relative and root-absolute paths cannot be resolved against it either
 * ("Invalid relative url or base scheme isn't hierarchical"). `linkEngineImports`
 * therefore rewrites each supported specifier to a fully-qualified URL before
 * the import.
 *
 * ## How the target URLs are discovered
 *
 * Each specifier maps to a small proxy module under `./scriptRuntime/`. We
 * learn a proxy's URL by importing it and reading the `__SELF_URL__` it
 * exports — i.e. its own `import.meta.url`, evaluated inside the module.
 *
 * That indirection is the whole trick, and it is worth understanding before
 * changing it. The obvious alternative,
 *
 *     new URL('./scriptRuntime/threeRuntime.js', import.meta.url)
 *
 * is a build-time asset reference: Vite statically analyses that form and in a
 * production build inlines the target as a base64 `data:` URL. A `data:` URL
 * has no module-resolution base, so the proxy could not `import` three — which
 * is precisely why this file used to ship a hand-written allowlist of ~28
 * three classes read off a global, and why `import { InstancedMesh }` from a
 * user script silently produced `undefined`.
 *
 * Importing the proxy normally instead makes it a real chunk that the bundler
 * resolves like any other module. Its `import.meta.url` is then the dev server
 * URL (dev) or the emitted chunk's hashed URL (build) — absolute in both
 * cases, so a `blob:`-hosted script can import it. And because the proxy and
 * the engine both import the same bare `"three/webgpu"` specifier, they share
 * one module instance: script-side classes are the engine's constructors.
 *
 * The imports are lazy — nothing is fetched until the first user script is
 * linked, so projects with no scripts pay nothing.
 */

/**
 * Specifier → proxy module loader. Every entry resolves to a module exporting
 * `__SELF_URL__`.
 *
 * `"three"` and `"three/webgpu"` intentionally share one proxy. They are
 * distinct module instances with distinct class identities; if a script
 * imported the plain `three` build while the engine ran on `three/webgpu`,
 * its `Vector3` would not be the engine's `Vector3` and `instanceof` checks
 * would quietly fail. The webgpu build is a superset, so routing both here is
 * safe and keeps exactly one three in the bundle.
