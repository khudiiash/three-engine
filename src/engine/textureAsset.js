// such task leaves the material permanently white. The editable source image is

//
// The timeout only guards a genuine HANG. It is deliberately not tight: a real

// them, misreporting a healthy transcoder as broken. Gate submissions to the
// pool size so every started transcode is measured, not its wait in line.
