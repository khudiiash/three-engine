/**
 * The project's event catalog — the list of events a *game* declares, as
 * opposed to the ones the engine itself emits.
 *
 * This module is deliberately pure: it imports nothing, touches no globals, and
 * never reaches for the filesystem. Four very different callers need the same
 * answers and none of them can afford to disagree —
 *
 *   - the Events panel, validating what the user types;
 *   - `Engine.applyEvents`, hydrating the live catalog at boot;
 *   - `projectEventTypes.js`, generating the `.d.ts` that makes the names
 *     type-checked in scripts;
 *   - the exporter, carrying the catalog into a build.
 *
 * ## Why a catalog instead of one asset per event
 *
 * Unity's ScriptableObject "GameEvent" pattern makes each event a file so it
 * can be dragged into an inspector slot. We get the same wiring from a typed
 * dropdown, and a file per event would mean a second thing to keep in sync with
 * the generated declarations. The catalog lives in `project.json` next to the
 * `input` block, which is the same kind of project-wide, panel-authored data
 * and already has a working editor around it.
 */

/**
 * Parameter types an event can declare.
 *
 * The set is the intersection of two constraints: it has to be expressible as a
 * TypeScript type (so the generated declarations are useful), and it has to be
 * editable as a literal value in the inspector (so a wired-up action can supply
 * one without a script). Anything failing either test belongs in `any`.
 *
 * `ts` is written as an inline `import(...)` rather than a bare name because the
 * generated file is a module augmentation in the *user's* project — three is
 * reachable through their tsconfig `paths`, but nothing is in lexical scope.
 * `Entity` is the exception: inside `declare module "engine"` it resolves to the
 * engine's own export.
