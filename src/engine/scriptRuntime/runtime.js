/**
 * Runtime module exposed to user scripts as `import ... from "engine"`.
 *
 * Three kinds of exports live here:
 *   1. Engine-specific surface — `Script` (base class) and the `attribute`
 *      decorator. `ScriptComponent` injects `entity` / `engine` / `THREE` /
 *      `input` on every script instance regardless of base class, so
 *      `extends Script` is a typed no-op.
 *   2. three's math and value types, re-exported. These are not wrappers —
 *      `Vector3` here IS three's `Vector3`, the same constructor the engine
 *      itself uses, so vectors cross the script boundary without conversion
 *      and `instanceof` works.
 *   3. Component classes — the same constructors the engine registers — so
 *      scripts can write `entity.getComponent(MeshComponent)` without
 *      stringly-typed keys.
 *
 * ## What belongs here vs. in `"three"`
 *
 * `"engine"` is the authored surface: the vocabulary you need to write game
 * logic against entities and components. That includes math (you cannot write
 * a single line of gameplay without vectors) but deliberately NOT the three
 * scene graph — `Mesh`, `InstancedMesh`, materials, geometries, loaders.
 * Entities own the scene graph, and reaching for those types means you want
 * the escape hatch, which is a first-class option:
 *
 *     import * as THREE from "three";        // the whole real three
 *     import { Fn, uniform } from "three/tsl";
 *
 * Both resolve to the exact module instances the engine is built against —
 * see `threeRuntime.js` / `tslRuntime.js`. Nothing is hidden or shimmed, so
 * the full three ecosystem stays reachable from a script.
 *
 * This module used to read its three classes off `globalThis.__ENGINE_THREE__`
 * because it shipped as a `data:` URL with no module-resolution base. It is
 * now a real chunk that imports three directly, so that global handshake —
 * and the boot-ordering failure it created ("the engine must finish booting
 * before user scripts run") — is gone.
