/**
 * Per-frame frustum state, owned by the Engine. One THREE.Frustum, one
 * scratch Sphere, one inverse world matrix — all reused, zero per-frame
 * allocations.
 *
 * Why a sphere, not a box?
 *   `Frustum.intersectsSphere` is six plane tests (~6 dot products).
 *   `Frustum.intersectsBox` projects eight OBB corners through the
 *   view-projection matrix, which is ~8 vec4 multiplies + a box test.
 *   For "is any geometry from this entity visible" the sphere is the
 *   correct primitive — a false positive (sphere pokes in but the mesh is
 *   behind a wall) just means one extra frame of the gated component
 *   running, which is harmless; a false negative would defeat the
 *   optimisation. So we pay ~3-5x less per entity per frame.
 *
 * Camera-hash dirty check:
 *   The frustum is rebuilt only when the active camera's world matrix or
 *   projection matrix changes. In a static editor viewport that's once
 *   per camera move; in a game running with a fixed camera it's once at
 *   startup. Components that query the frustum still pay the sphere test
 *   each frame, but skip the matrix multiply.
