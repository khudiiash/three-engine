/**
 * Baking an octahedral impostor atlas (roadmap item 14).
 *
 * An impostor is the last LOD level of a prop: past the distance where even a
 * few hundred triangles are more than the silhouette deserves, the object is
 * replaced by ONE camera-facing quad showing a pre-rendered view of it. That is
 * what makes a forest possible — a tree at 200 m costs two triangles and one
 * texture fetch, and five hundred of them batch into a single draw.
 *
 * ## What is in the atlas, and why two of them
 *
 * Each cell holds one view of the object from one octahedral direction:
 *
 *   - **albedo + coverage** — the object's colour, and alpha as the silhouette
 *     mask (an alpha-tested quad, so a tree reads as a tree rather than as a
 *     rectangle),
 *   - **normal** — the surface normal in the object's own space.
 *
 * The normal atlas is what makes the impostor a lit surface rather than a
 * sticker. Baking the LIT appearance instead would be simpler and is wrong in a
 * way that only shows up later: the lighting is frozen at bake time, so the
 * impostor keeps its noon shading at dusk, ignores the shadow it is standing
 * in, and — worst — is lit differently from the LOD level it replaces, so the
 * switch that was supposed to be invisible becomes a brightness pop.
 *
 * ## The neutral bake environment
 *
 * To capture something close to albedo out of arbitrary materials (which may be
 * shader graphs — there is no `material.color` to read), the bake renders the
 * object in its own scene lit by a single white ambient light and nothing else.
 * Three's ambient light supplies irradiance; Lambert diffuse divides that by
 * PI. A unit neutral bake therefore needs PI irradiance to return albedo,
 * rather than baking another 1/PI darkening into the final lit surface. A
 * metal or a mirror returns something darker, which is
 * the accepted cost of not owning every material's shading model. Tone mapping
 * is switched off for the same reason — a tone-mapped bake would be tone-mapped
 * a second time when the impostor is drawn.
 *
 * ## Why the atlas is read back to a DataTexture
 *
 * The obvious thing is to keep the render target and sample its texture. This
 * reads the pixels back and builds an ordinary `DataTexture` instead, for three
 * reasons: the vertical orientation of a sampled render-target texture is a
 * backend convention (and a silently flipped atlas looks like a modelling
 * error, not a bug); the render targets — including their depth buffers — are
 * freed immediately afterwards; and the atlas becomes plain data, so a test can
 * assert what was baked without a screenshot, and a future version can write it
 * to disk as an asset.
