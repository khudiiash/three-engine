/**
 * The impostor material (roadmap item 14).
 *
 * One camera-facing quad showing the octahedral atlas baked by
 * `impostorBake.js`: the three views around the current direction, blended, and
 * lit from the baked normal.
 *
 * ## Everything is per-INSTANCE, and that is the point
 *
 * A forest of impostors that costs one draw call per tree is not an
 * optimisation: the LOD mesh it replaces was already being merged into a single
 * instanced draw by `batching.js` (five hundred identical props share a
 * geometry and a material, which is exactly what that system looks for). An
 * impostor that broke out of the batch would trade a thousand vertices for
 * four hundred and ninety-nine extra draw submissions — on a CPU-bound frame,
 * a straight loss.
 *
 * So the billboard is driven entirely by INSTANCED ATTRIBUTES — centre, size
 * and the object's two world axes — and never by the model matrix. One
 * `InstancedBufferGeometry`, one material, one draw call for every impostor
 * sharing an atlas, and no dependency on how three's own instancing rewrites
 * `positionLocal`. The mesh that carries them sits at the scene root with an
 * identity transform, so local space IS world space here; `ImpostorSystem` owns
 * that invariant.
 *
 * ## The billboard is in the vertex stage, and it is a POSITION node
 *
 * Same reason as the VFX ribbons (item 13): the viewport camera, the game
 * camera and every shadow cascade draw the same buffer in the same frame, so a
 * billboard computed on the CPU is correct for at most one of them.
 *
 * What differs here is WHICH node does it. three ships a `billboarding()`
 * helper that returns a clip-space position for `material.vertexNode`, and
 * using it would break this material specifically: `vertexNode` replaces the
 * final position without touching `positionWorld`, which would then still
 * describe the un-billboarded quad. The offset is therefore applied through
 * `positionNode`, so world position, view position, and lighting agree with
 * where the quad really is. Atlas projection retains the original billboard
 * position separately: vertex animation must carry the texture with the quad,
 * while lighting and GI continue to see its deformed world position.
 *
 * ## Three frames, weighted, premultiplied
 *
 * Sampling only the nearest view makes the whole billboard switch to a
 * different rendering of the object between one frame and the next — about 15°
 * of apparent rotation at eight frames, which reads as the scenery twitching as
 * the player walks. The three surrounding views are blended by their
 * barycentric weights instead (see `octahedral.js`).
 *
 * The blend is premultiplied by alpha and divided out at the end. Straight
 * averaging pulls the empty background of one view into the silhouette of
 * another, which puts a dark fringe around every leaf — the classic "my
 * impostors have a halo", and it comes from the blend, not from the bake.
