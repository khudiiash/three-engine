/**
 * The value a material ACTUALLY SHADES WITH for `metalness` / `roughness`,
 * resolved per material at shader-build time.
 *
 * `TSL.metalness` / `TSL.roughness` are `materialReference(...)` accessors:
 * they read the JS SCALARS `material.metalness` / `material.roughness`. But
 * `MeshStandardNodeMaterial.setupVariants` prefers the NODES whenever they are
 * set — `this.metalnessNode ? float(this.metalnessNode) : materialMetalness` —
 * and the editor's shader-graph compiler sets them on every material it
 * builds, leaving the asset's scalars at whatever they happened to be. So the
 * scalars describe a DIFFERENT material than the one on screen, and writing
 * them into the matParams MRT hands SSR that different material.
 *
 * Not hypothetical, and not subtle in its effect: the mirror cube in the
 * user's Sponza is graph metalness 1 / roughness 0 over asset scalars 0 / 0.7,
 * so it arrived at SSR as a rough dielectric and the addon's `metalness <= 0`
 * discard threw away every one of its pixels (SSRNode.js:911). A perfect
 * mirror rendered PURE BLACK — at every distance, and at every `maxDistance`,
 * which is what makes it read as "SSR has a range limit" rather than "SSR was
 * told this mirror is plaster". GI hit the same disagreement on the same
 * material and resolved it the same way (`giLight.js:1429`).
 *
 * An `Fn` body receives the NodeBuilder, and a shader node's properties are
 * cached per builder, so this re-runs for each material's fragment shader.
 * Materials with no node (anything glTF-loaded) fall through to the scalar,
 * which for them is the value they shade with.

 * against it throws `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'depthTexture')`.

/**
 * Per-camera post-processing component.
 *
 * The component owns a {@link THREE.RenderPipeline} fed by a compiled TSL
 * graph. When the camera it lives on is the engine's active camera, the
 * pipeline replaces the engine's default `renderer.render(scene, camera)`
 * call.
 *
 * The graph is anchored by an Input pseudo-source that resolves to the
 * four auto-fed sockets of a TSL `pass(scene, camera)` node:
 *
 *   - `color`  → `pass.getTextureNode()` (the beauty render)
 *   - `depth`  → `pass.getTextureNode('depth')` (the depth attachment)
 *   - `normal` → packed view-space normal MRT
 *   - `velocity` → motion-vector MRT for temporal effects such as TRAA
 *
 * The `RenderPipeline` handles ALL the render-target bookkeeping
 * internally: it discovers the `PassNode` inside the compiled TSL graph,
 * allocates a color + depth render target the right size, renders the
 * scene into it through the WebGPU backend's managed target switching
 * (which preserves scissor/viewport state correctly), then runs the
 * post-graph fullscreen quad to the canvas.
 *
 * We never call `renderer.setRenderTarget()` from JS — manual target
 * swapping from outside the renderer's own `render()` desynchronizes
 * the WebGPU backend's cached render area and triggers validation
 * errors like "Scissor rect not contained in the render area dimensions".
 *
 * Disabling the component (or removing it) drops the override and the
 * engine falls back to its normal canvas-direct render. Multiple cameras
 * in a scene each manage their own pipeline independently; only the
 * ACTIVE camera's component participates on any given frame.
 *
 * The graph is a `.post` document named by `props.asset` — one look, authored
 * once, shared by every camera that points at it. `props.graph` is the older
 * inline form and still renders when no asset is assigned, so scenes that
 * predate the document format keep working; `activeGraph()` is where the two
 * are resolved. Either way a fresh component starts with a one-node
 * passthrough, so adding a PostprocessComponent renders the scene unchanged
 * until the user opens the editor and adds nodes.
