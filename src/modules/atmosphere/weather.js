 * ⭐ WEATHER AS ONE BLENDABLE VECTOR, NEVER AS A MODE SWITCH.
 *
 * Every preset here is the SAME set of numbers with different values, and
 * everything downstream (sky, clouds, fog, wind, precipitation, the sun's
 * dimming) reads only from the blended result. That is the whole design, and
 * it buys the two things a mode switch cannot:
 *
 *   1. A transition is a lerp, so "clear → storm over 40 s" is free and looks
 *      like weather arriving rather than like a cut.
 *   2. RAIN AND SNOW ARE SEPARATE CHANNELS, not one enum. Crossing from rain
 *      to snow therefore passes through sleet on its own, and the temperature
 *      model can hold a scene at 1 °C with both channels half-open, which is
 *      exactly what that day looks like out of a window.
 *
 * ⚠ NOTHING HERE KNOWS ABOUT THREE, THE SCENE OR THE CLOCK. It is a pure
 * function of (previous state, dt, season, temperature) so `npm run
 * test:atmosphere` can run a year of simulated weather in a millisecond and
 * assert that a July scene at 45° N never snows and a January one does.
