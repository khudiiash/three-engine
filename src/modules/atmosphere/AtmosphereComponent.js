/**
 * ⭐⭐⭐ ONE COMPONENT FOR THE SKY AND THE WEATHER, BECAUSE THEY ARE ONE THING.
 *
 * A storm is not "rain particles plus a darker sky preset". It is one
 * atmospheric state that the sun's colour, the sky's brightness, the cloud
 * deck, the fog, the wind every curtain and every tree is already reading, and
 * the rain, all agree about. Splitting that across a Sky component and a
 * Weather component means two sources of truth for cloud cover, and the first
 * thing that goes wrong is a scene lit like noon under a sky full of thunder.
 *
 * So the ownership here is deliberately wide, and each piece is pushed to the
 * seam that already exists rather than to a new one:
 *
 *   sky picture   → `scene.backgroundNode`  (`skyNode.js`)
 *   sky lighting  → `scene.environment`, a half-float equirect that GI's sky
 *                   bins can read on the CPU (`skyModel.js`)
 *   sun / moon    → the scene's directional light, aimed and coloured
 *   fog           → `scene.fog`, coloured from the sky's own horizon
 *   wind          → `engine.windOverride`, which cloth and foliage already
 *                   read as "the scene's wind"
 *   rain / snow   → two instanced draws, no simulation (`precipitation.js`)
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT IT TAKES OVER, IT GIVES BACK. Every scene value it drives is saved at
 * attach and restored on detach or disable, because an Atmosphere is something
 * you switch on to look at a scene and off to go back to authoring it.
