/**
 * ⭐⭐ WEATHER ON THE GROUND, NOT ONLY IN THE SKY.
 *
 * A snowstorm over a summer-green world is the single thing that most gives a
 * weather system away, and it is what the user asked for: when it snows, the
 * world goes white; when it rains, the world goes dark and glossy. Both are
 * SURFACE properties, so both have to reach every material in the scene.
 *
 * ## Where it hooks, and why there
 *
 * three's `NodeMaterial` builds its shading in a fixed order — `setupDiffuseColor`,
 * then `setupVariants` (roughness, metalness, and `diffuseContribution`, which
 * is derived from the two). So:
 *
 *   · ALBEDO is patched by wrapping `setupDiffuseColor`: the original runs (map,
 *     vertex colours, whatever the material actually does), and the weather
 *     mixes into the result. Wrapping rather than replacing is what lets this
 *     compose with ANY material, including shader-graph ones.
 *   · ROUGHNESS and METALNESS go through the material's own node SLOTS, wrapped
 *     around whatever was already there. ⚠ They cannot be assigned inside a
 *     `setupVariants` wrapper: `diffuseContribution` — which is not exported
 *     from `three/tsl` and so cannot be re-assigned from out here — is computed
 *     inside the original from the LOCAL metalness node, so a later assignment
 *     to the `metalness` property would light the snow with the old metalness.
 *
 * ## ⛔ IT PATCHES ONCE, AT ATTACH, AND THE UNIFORMS DO THE REST
 *
 * Changing a material's node graph recompiles its pipeline, and a compile wave
 * is the most expensive thing that happens in this engine (see the project's
 * zero-freeze work). Patching when it starts to snow would therefore put a
 * multi-second hitch exactly on the frame the storm arrives. So every eligible
 * material is patched once when the Atmosphere attaches, with `snow` and
 * `wetness` at zero — and the whole term is wrapped in a uniform-driven branch
 * that costs one comparison while the weather is dry.
