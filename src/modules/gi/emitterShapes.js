// ANALYTIC EMITTER SHAPES — the scalar reference for every emitter-slot kind,
// and the ONE place that decides which analytic shape a three.js geometry is.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Promoted emissive meshes light the scene analytically
// (giLight.js emitterSlotFactor); everything the analytic path cannot
// represent falls back to the voxel field, whose lattice is exactly the
// "blocky and flickery" light the user reports from moving/rotating lamps.
// Before 2026-08-08 the analytic path knew two shapes: sphere and oriented
// box, so a cylinder/torus/cone/capsule/disc lamp was lit (and reflected, and
// shadowed) as its bounding box. This file adds the missing shapes as CLOSED
// FORMS, each verified against Monte-Carlo surface integration in
// scripts/run-gi-emitter-shapes-test.mjs.
//
// THE CONTRACT. Everything here is scalar JS with no TSL: the GPU versions in
// giLight.js mirror these bodies EXPRESSION FOR EXPRESSION, and the test
// arbitrates THIS file against brute-force integration. If you change a
// formula here, change its TSL twin (the function names match) — a divergence
// between the two shows up as light that changes when the same lamp is viewed
// via a different path (receiver direct vs feedback inject vs reflection hit).
//
// CONVENTIONS (identical to giLight.js):
//   · factor F = ∫ over the shape's visible solid angle of cosθ_receiver dω,
//     so irradiance E = slot radiance · F, and F ∈ [0, π].
//   · P = receiver world position, N = unit receiver normal.
//   · A slot's shape lives in `kind` + `center` + `half` + axes bx/by/bz
//     (unit, world) + `radius` (world bounding sphere, the active gate and
//     trace self-exclusion — every kind keeps it).
//   · `by` IS THE SYMMETRY AXIS for every shaped kind. The fitter maps each
//     geometry's local axis onto by (cylinder family: local Y; torus/disc
//     family: local Z), so the shader never needs to know which local axis a
//     geometry used.
//
// SLOT `half` SEMANTICS PER KIND (world units, scale already applied):
//   0 sphere   — unused (radius carries the shape)
//   1 box      — half extents along bx/by/bz (pre-existing)
//   2 capsule  — x: tube radius, y: HALF the cylinder-section length, z: = x
//   3 cylinder — x: radius, y: half height, z: = x (flat caps)
//   4 frustum  — x: radius at the −by end, y: half height, z: radius at +by
//                (cone = frustum with z = 0)
//   5 disc     — x: outer radius, y: ~0 (thickness epsilon), z: inner radius
//                (0 for a full disc; RingGeometry sets it)
//   6 torus    — x: ring radius (centreline), y: tube radius, z: tube radius
//
// THE MATH, shape by shape (derivations kept because the next reader will
// otherwise re-derive them wrong — I did, twice, before the MC arbiter):
//
// TUBE SIDE (capsule/cylinder/frustum lateral surface). A diffuse cylinder of
// radius r and radiance L radiates, per unit length, like a diffuse LINE with
// intensity I(direction) = L·2r·sinα (α = angle to the axis): the projected
// silhouette width is 2r from every side direction. This line model is
// energy-EXACT (∫ 2rL·sinα dΩ = 2π²rL = the side's true emitted flux) and
// error only appears in the near field (d ≲ 2r), where the MC test bounds it.
// With the receiver at the origin, ĉ = unit vector to the axis FOOT
// (perpendicular), h = distance to the axis, ℓ̂ = axis direction, a point on
// the axis is x(u) = h·ĉ + u·ℓ̂ and
//   E/L = 2·∫ r(u) · (h/d) · (h·Cn + u·Ln)/d / d² du,   d² = h²+u²,
//         Cn = ĉ·N, Ln = ℓ̂·N, r(u) = ra + s·u (s = slope, 0 for a cylinder).
// Expanding gives three primitive integrals with closed forms:
//   A(u) = u/(2(h²+u²)) + atan(u/h)/(2h)     [= h²·∫du/d⁴]
//   B(u) = −1/(2(h²+u²))                     [=    ∫u·du/d⁴]
//   C(u) = −u/(2(h²+u²)) + atan(u/h)/(2h)    [=    ∫u²·du/d⁴]
//   E/L = 2·( ra·Cn·ΔA + (ra·Ln + s·h·Cn)·h·ΔB + s·Ln·h·ΔC )
// The receiver-horizon factor (h·Cn + u·Ln) is LINEAR in u, so the horizon
// clip is EXACT: intersect [u0,u1] with the half-line where it is positive.
// (This is what the box path approximates with per-face max(0) — the tube
// gets it exactly for free.)
//
// SPHERE-CAP ENDS (capsule): each hemisphere cap ≈ half a sphere light at its
// end centre (exact in the far field: the two hemispheres project to one full
// disc πr², and two half-weight spheres project the same). Orientation of the
// caps is ignored; the MC test bounds what that costs (a few % of the total,
// worst side-on close up).
//
// DISC (and cylinder/frustum caps, and rings). The vector irradiance of a
// one-sided diffuse disc has an exact closed form. With H = height of the
// receiver above the disc plane (emitting side), ρ = in-plane distance from
// the disc axis, r = disc radius:
//   X  = r² + ρ² + H²
//   Q  = √(X² − 4·r²·ρ²)        [= √((H²+ρ²−r²)² + 4H²r²), same number]
//   V_ax  = (π/2)·(1 − (H²+ρ²−r²)/Q)      — component along −d̂ (toward the
//            plane; on-axis check: π·r²/(r²+H²), the classic result)
//   V_rad = (π·H/(2ρ))·(1 − X/Q)          — component along m̂ (axis→receiver
//            in-plane; ≤ 0 always — the disc pulls toward its axis)
//   F = max(0, N·(V_ax·(−d̂) + V_rad·m̂))
// Both come from φ-integrals of 1/d⁴ (∫dφ/(a−b·cosφ)² = 2πa/(a²−b²)^{3/2} et
// al.) followed by one radial integral; the far field limits reproduce the
// point-source vector irradiance exactly, and the MC test holds the general
// position to ~1%. A RING is the difference of two discs — the vector form is
// linear in the emitting region, so F_ring = F_disc(rOuter) − F_disc(rInner),
// still exact. Horizon handling is the same clamped-linear convention as box
// faces (exact when the whole disc is above the receiver's horizon, a smooth
// under-estimate when it straddles it).
//
// TORUS. No usable closed form exists; the model is K chord segments of tube
// around the centreline circle, ANCHORED TO THE RECEIVER'S AZIMUTH: segment
// midpoints start at the in-plane direction toward the receiver, so the
// approximation is rotation-invariant about the torus axis (a spinning torus
// lamp cannot flicker by construction) and seam-free as the receiver moves
// (the anchor direction turns smoothly with P — no trig needed, just the
// normalized in-plane component of P−center). The chord polygon is shorter
// than the arc; the tube radius is scaled by arc/chord so the model's surface
// area (and far-field power) stays exact. Self-shadowing of the far side is
// ignored (the hole sees through) — the MC arbiter, WITH real torus
// self-occlusion, bounds the total error.
//
// POLYHEDRA (tetra/octa/icosa/dodeca). Round-ish solids: a sphere of equal
// SURFACE AREA (Cauchy: mean projected area = S/4 for convex bodies, so equal
// area ⇒ equal far-field power). The constants below are S(circumradius r)
// exactly; the test re-derives them from real geometry triangles. detail ≥ 1
// re-projects vertices to the circumsphere, so those use the sphere directly.
//
// WHAT DELIBERATELY STAYS A BOX: partial spheres/cylinders/rings (thetaLength
// < 2π — an arc section's OBB is honest), Extrude/Shape/Tube/Text, and any
// imported BufferGeometry that primitiveFit.js does not recognise. Lathe maps
// to a cylinder (its OBB is square in cross-section — a vase lamp would glow
// as a box), TorusKnot to its torus (shape-true pool and reflection; its
// extra curve length under-reports energy slightly, documented there).

/**
 * ONE PLANAR EMITTING QUAD'S EXACT LAMBERT FORM FACTOR, CLIPPED TO THE
 * RECEIVER'S HORIZON — the scalar twin of giLight.js's `polyHorizonFactor`.
 *
 * `verts` are the four corners as vectors FROM the receiver, unnormalized and
 * in winding order. The contour formula (Baum et al.) integrates the whole
 * polygon whether or not the receiver can see all of it, and the part below
 * the tangent plane integrates NEGATIVELY. The previous version answered that
 * with `max(faceSum, 0)` on the face TOTAL, which is only right when the face
 * is entirely below the horizon.
 *
 * ⚠ WHEN IT IS NOT RIGHT IT RETURNS ZERO FOR A FACE THAT IS HALF VISIBLE, and
 * that is the user's 2026-08-20 report: "the emitters do not light surfaces if
 * their meshes overlap with them; move the emitter to the side and they start
 * emitting". Overlap is exactly the configuration that puts a receiver BETWEEN
 * a box's two opposing face planes, so the visible faces straddle its horizon
 * and every one of them clamped away. Measured against the brute-force MC
 * arbiter, a pillar face 0.05 m from a straddling emissive box read **0.000 of
 * a true 3.06** — and 0.14x to 0.58x through the whole transition band — then
 * snapped to 1.00x the moment the box cleared the receiver's plane. A hard
 * discontinuity in what is physically a smooth field, which is why it read as
 * "no light at all" rather than "a bit dim".
 *
 * So: CLIP FIRST, INTEGRATE SECOND. Sutherland-Hodgman against
 * `dot(v, N) = 0` in LINEAR space (the intersection of an edge with a plane is
 * linear; the same point on the unit sphere is not, so normalizing before the
 * clip would bend every cut edge), then the same contour sum over what
 * survives. Restores 0.99-1.01x of MC across the entire sweep, overlap
 * included. `max(0)` stays as a floating-point floor only — after clipping,
 * every surviving vertex is on or above the tangent plane, so the sum cannot
 * be meaningfully negative.
