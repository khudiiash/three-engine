// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — THE WORLD BUNDLE AND THE OCCUPANCY-ONLY SHADOW ARMS.
//
// This file exists to unblock the §5 deletion sweep. `giField.js` owns two
// things that are NOT transport machinery and therefore cannot die with it:
//
//   · `createSoftShadowTrace` — the sphere-traced soft shadow, which is
//     `light.shadowTraceFn` (emitter shadows at pixels) and the records-absent
//     fallback arm of the GI-traced light shadows;
//   · `createWidthProbe` — the analytic mid-field penumbra width term, which is
//     on the DEFAULT path of BOTH surviving shadow arms (the record march
//     supplies admission, this supplies softness).
//
// Both took their base distance from `texture3D(distanceTexture, …)`, so as long
// as they lived there, deleting the composited distance field deleted the
// shipping soft shadows. Plan §12.5.
//
// ══ WHY THIS IS A SMALLER CHANGE THAN §4.2 AND §12.5 BOTH ASSUME ═══════════════
//
// §4.2 called `freeRadiusAtWorld` the width probe's "fallback"; §12.5 corrected
// that to "a refinement, not a fallback" and concluded that swapping the oracle
// in wholesale would trade a continuous distance for a staircase of voxel boxes.
// Both statements are about the SDF-baking build. In the shipping build they
// describe the wrong thing, and the reason is one line — `giField.js`'s
// composite, under `killSdf` (which is `!!occField`, i.e. always):
//
//     minD.assign(occField.freeRadiusAtWorld(p, undefined, true, world.capWorld))
//
// The composited distance field IS the oracle. Not a different, better-behaved
// distance source that the oracle sharpens — the same function, evaluated at
// coarse cell centres, quantized to fp16 and read back through hardware
// trilinear. So relative to what ships today, evaluating the oracle directly:
//
//   · cannot lose distance accuracy, because it is the accuracy the composite
//     RESAMPLES. It gains: no fp16 step, no 0.33m low-pass, and sub-cell detail
//     everywhere instead of only where `dRaw < 2·minCell` opened the gate;
//   · is strictly MORE conservative. Trilinear interpolation of a 1-Lipschitz
//     function overshoots between samples, so the composite reports free space
//     that is not there — up to about half a coarse cell of it. The oracle never
//     does (`srcVolumeRef.js` measures both);
//   · gives up exactly one thing: the low-pass was also SMOOTHING the ladder's
//     per-level jumps. That is the whole regression risk, it is bounded by
//     0.5·voxel·2^L at the level that jumps, and it is what the A/B measures.
//
// So the gate here is not "is the oracle good enough to replace a better
// distance" — it is "does removing a blur that was never asked for cost
// anything". `scripts/run-gi-src-volume-test.mjs` answers the numeric half on
// the CPU; `__giSrcVolumeShadows` (giField.js) is the seam that answers the
// visual half on the real chain, with everything but the distance source held
// byte-identical.
//
// ══ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY COPIED RATHER THAN SHARED ════════════════════════════
//
// The estimator bodies below are near-transcriptions of `createShadowTrace` and
// `createWidthProbeFn`. That is intentional and temporary in the other
// direction: the giField originals must stay BYTE-IDENTICAL while they are the
// A/B baseline, so factoring the shared parts out would change the control. When
// the deletion sweep lands, the originals go and these become the only copies.
// Every tuned constant is carried over with its derivation intact — the cuts,
// the closest-approach pairing, the cap saturation, the fail-closed clamp — for
// the reason §12.4 records: a rewrite that re-derives the constants is not an
// A/B of the distance source, it is an A/B of everything at once.

/**
 * The volume bundle SRC hands to the screen chain: the two shadow factories, the
 * world uniforms, and the spine every survivor stands on. `giField.js`'s
 * equivalent carries six radiance buffers, a distance texture, a slot atlas, a
 * sparse brick page table and a composite pass on top; every one of THOSE is
 * transport and dies in §5.
 *
 * Signature-compatible with the `volume` object at the surviving call sites —
 * `createSoftShadowTrace(lift, steps, name, stable)`, `createWidthProbe(name)`,
 * `world`, `occupancyField`, `rayHitMode`, `distance`, plus `res`/`bounds`/
 * `cell`/`minCell`/`capWorld`/`setBounds` (§12.8.2) — so the GISystem rewrite
 * can swap the producer without touching the consumers, which is what keeps that
 * edit reviewable. NOT compatible with, and never will be: `compositeCompute`,
 * `distanceTexture`, `grid`, `sparse`, `updateGrid`, `updateSparse`,
 * `coarseLevel`, `atlas`, `createSceneTrace`, `readbackStats` and the six
 * buffers. Those call sites are the deletion, not the swap.
 *
 * `world` may be supplied by the caller. The A/B seam passes giField's own
 * bundle so the two arms share one set of tuned constants and differ ONLY in
 * the distance source; production builds let this construct its own.
 *
 * ══ FIELD-LESS MODE (plan §10 / §10.1) ════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `occField: null` with `bounds` (or a `world`) is the BVH-only build: the
 * volume is bounds + a nominal cell (`minCell`, see `createSrcWorld`) and
 * NOTHING else. The bundle keeps its shape so the 40-odd call sites need no
 * branch of their own, and every member that would have closed over the field
 * reports its absence the same way — `occupancyField: null`, `distance: null`,
 * and the two shadow factories RETURN NULL rather than throwing, so a consumer
 * feature-detects with `volume.createWidthProbe?.() ?? null` exactly as the
 * emitter-record arm already does. `setBounds` still refits the world; the
 * `occField?.refit()` it would have chained is simply not there. The one thing
 * that still throws is having neither a field nor bounds, because that volume
 * would have no size at all.
