// SLOT REGISTRY — the CPU-side census of GI placements.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE USED TO BE, because the name still carries it: a per-mesh SDF
// atlas. Every GI-relevant mesh got a 64³ tile in one Data3DTexture of fp16
// local distances, plus nine per-slot uniform arrays that mapped world points
// into its local grid, and TSL to sample it (`sampleSlot`) and to min() a few
// DETAIL slots per trace step (`refineDetail`). All of that is gone:
//   · the SDF bake pipeline was deleted 2026-08-02 (SDF-free won on
//     measurement — see the killSdf note in GISystem);
//   · the GPU composite that bound the uniform arrays was deleted with the
//     dense transport (SRC rebuild §12.8/§12.9);
//   · the tile texture had ALREADY been reduced to a 4×4×4 token holding "far",
//     because no bake could ever arrive to fill it — the real 58 MB was
//     reclaimed then, so this deletion frees code, not VRAM.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT IS LOAD-BEARING and is why the file survives at all. Something
// has to know which placements exist, carry each one's surface, and NOTICE WHEN
// ONE MOVES — `revision` is the wake signal the occupancy pyramid's refresh
// branch triggers on (GISystem#tick), so without this census a dragged mesh
// would mark the field dirty and nothing would ever consume it.
//
// It is pure CPU state now: no texture, no uniforms, no TSL. Slot numbering is
// still stable for a slot's life because `assignments[i]` is how a live scene
// entry is matched to a seated placement across frames (#syncSlots).
import * as THREE from "three/webgpu";

// 768 placements. The ceiling is WebGPU's guaranteed 64KB uniform-buffer
// binding — but per OBJECT GROUP, not per array, and that distinction is a
// measured breakage, not a nicety.
//
// The 512 it shipped at cost Bistro two thirds of its geometry: `1020 of 1532
// placements could not seat (slots 512) — they are invisible to GI` — no
// bounce, no occupancy, no shadow, which reads as blotchy part-lit streets,
// not as an error. Overflow seating is first-come by collect order (GISystem
// breaks at this constant), so WHICH two thirds vanished was an accident of
// hierarchy order on top of it.
//
// ⚠ 1024 WAS TRIED (2026-08-16) AND IS INVALID. Per-array arithmetic said it
// fit exactly: occupancyField's `localToWorld` is one mat4 per slot, and
// 1024 × 64B = 65,536B = precisely maxUniformBufferBindingSize. But three
// packs ALL of a compute object's uniformArrays into ONE object-group UBO
// (`bindGroup_object`), so `localToWorld` shares its 64KB with `slotDynamic`
// ((N+1) floats at 16B WGSL uniform stride, ~16.4KB at 1024) — 80KB in one
// binding. Every GI compute submit then failed with
//   Invalid BindGroup "bindGroup_object" … Queue.Submit(<invalid>)
// and a dropped submit renders as a BLACK GI FIELD, not as an error dialog.
// This is also the real reason the original constant was "half the limit":
// the other half was headroom for exactly this co-packing.
//
// 768 is the fit under co-packing: 48KB (matrices) + 12.3KB (slotDynamic)
// ≈ 60.3KB ≤ 64KB. Going higher means moving `localToWorld` to a storage
// buffer first — and checking the voxelize kernel's storage-buffer count
// against maxStorageBuffersPerShaderStage before adding one.
//
// Everything else audited 2026-08-16: palette uniforms (N×2 vec4s) live on a
// different kernel's object group; slotRegistry itself is plain CPU arrays;
// the mover arrays (spheres/halfs/quats) are sized by the MOVER cap, not this.
// Still the pyramid's own slot ceiling (GISystem passes it as `slotCapacity`)
// and the two must not disagree.
