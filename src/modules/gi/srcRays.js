// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — Algorithm 3, the ray budget.
//
// Counts propagate UP (a parent's count is the sum of its children's), then
// offsets are handed DOWN, so that every probe sharing a parent occupies a
// CONTIGUOUS segment of the one global R2 sequence. `srcRef.js`'s `assignRays`
// is the mirror and its header carries the WHY at length; the short version is
// that a coarse probe's 512 direction bins are covered semi-uniformly only
// because the rays reaching it are a contiguous R2 run. Hand each child an
// arbitrary scatter instead and bin coverage becomes a lottery — some bins get
// eight rays, some none, and the empty ones are exactly what the merge then has
// to renormalize around.
//
// ══ WHY THERE IS NO PREFIX SCAN AND NO CHILD LIST ═══════════════════════════
//
// Read as written, Alg. 3 wants two things the GPU is bad at: a prefix sum over
// the top cascade, and "the children of probe P", which is not a contiguous
// range anywhere and looks like it needs a compaction pass. Neither is
// necessary, and the same trick removes both.
//
// **An atomic cursor IS an offset allocator.** Give a parent a cursor
// initialized to its own `rayOffset` and let each child claim its slice with one
// `atomicAdd(cursor, myCount)` — the returned value IS the child's offset, and
// the claims partition the parent's range exactly, with no gaps and no overlaps.
// One atomic per probe replaces the compaction. The top cascade is the same
// move against a single global cursor, which replaces the scan.
//
// **What it does NOT preserve is ORDER within a parent.** The assignment is
// scheduler-dependent, so a probe's ray INDICES differ between two runs of the
// same frame. Every gate here must therefore check the PARTITION — each index
// used exactly once, each parent's children covering its range contiguously —
// and never the specific indices, exactly as `test:gi-src-probes` compares key
// sets rather than indirection indices, and for the same underlying reason.
// Under temporal accumulation the non-determinism is a mild positive: a probe's
// directions vary frame to frame, which is coverage the R2 sequence would not
// otherwise give.
//
// ══ WHY THE COUNTS DO NOT LIVE IN `probeTable` ══════════════════════════════
//
// `PROBE_RAYS` is reserved for exactly this and it is still written — but as a
// PLAIN COPY by the owning thread, after the fact. The accumulating counter has
// to be atomic (every pixel adds into its c0 probe, every child into its
// parent), and `probeTable` cannot become an atomic buffer: `srcGizmos.js` reads
// it from a VERTEX stage, where WebGPU only binds storage buffers read-only and
// an atomic needs read_write. Making the table atomic would silently cost the
// debug view.
//
// Aliasing one buffer behind both an atomic and a non-atomic node is the other
// obvious way out, and `srcProbes.js` already considered and rejected it — one
// buffer, one definition of what it is. So the accumulators are their own
// buffers, and the table keeps the settled answer.

  //
  //   1. propagate the NATURAL counts up, exactly [D2]'s shape on the cursor
  //      buffer — a parent's natural demand is the sum of its children's,
  //      the same statement [D2] makes about the capped counts;
  //   2. per probe, publish `round(65536 · capped/natural)` into the store's
  //      per-block influx region, where the decay reads it (srcDeposit.js)
  //      and slows to hold `influx/(1−keep′)` at its uncapped value.
  //
  // The publish covers ALL cascades: a parent's deposits are its children's
  // rays, so a capped child starves its whole ancestor chain and every block
  // on it needs the ratio, not just c0's. `natural == 0` publishes
  // INFLUX_ONE — no evidence was cut if none was demanded — which is also
  // what keeps a probe whose pixels sit outside this frame's residue class
  // from freezing its block's decay. Dead probes that still hold a block get
  // INFLUX_ONE the same way (their counts are zero), and a FREED block's
  // stale word is unreachable memory: the claim stamp zeroes it before any
  // new owner accumulates (§12.23.5).
  //
  // With the cap at PROBE_RAY_CAP_OFF the clamp never binds, capped == natural
  // everywhere, and every word is exactly INFLUX_ONE — the decay's
  // compensation branch never fires and the build is behaviourally the
  // uncapped one, same statement [D1'] makes.
