// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — the intersection backend.
//
// Extracted from `giField.js`'s `createOccupancySceneTrace`, with ONE structural
// change: this returns GEOMETRY ONLY. The old function fused tracing with hit
// shading, because the thing it shaded from was the radiance field it lived
// next to — sample the field at the hit point and you have the answer. SRC has
// no radiance field, so shading a hit means analytic NEE plus the secondary
// probe cache, which is `srcShade.js`'s job and not this file's.
//
// That split is the point. A trace that returns `{hit, t, position, normal,
// dynObj}` can be reused by the diffuse rays, the sun-visibility rays at hits,
// the emitter shadow rays and the secondary cache without any of them agreeing
// about what radiance means.
//
// ══ WHAT IS REUSED VERBATIM, AND WHY IT IS NOT REWRITTEN ═══════════════════
//
// The medium — occupancy bitset pyramid, hierarchical DDA, surface records,
// exact dynamic objects — stays exactly as it is. The paper traces with OptiX;
// we trace with this, and it is the single most measured piece of code in the
// module. Specifically preserved:
//
//   · HIERARCHICAL DDA WITH PYRAMID SKIP — it cannot tunnel. Every leak hunt in
//     38 sessions converged on that property; a "simpler" flat march
//     reintroduces the entire class.
//   · SURFACE RECORDS for sub-voxel hit positions and normals. Voxel-face
//     normals quantize every silhouette to a whole voxel, which is what made
//     rotated casters' shadows blocky.
//   · EXACT DYNAMIC OBJECTS via `composeFieldDynamics`, so a mover is HIT
//     GEOMETRY rather than something smeared into the medium. The paper leaves
//     movable objects to future work; this is the part of the old system that
//     survives as our own extension.
//   · R2/R3 tolerance discipline: every bias is derived from the OCCUPANCY
//     VOXEL size, never from probe spacing, and step exhaustion fails CLOSED
//     from detail and OPEN in open space. SRC's rays are LONGER than the dense
//     backend's interval rays, so R3 carries more load here, not less.

/**
 * Binary visibility toward a source, through the SAME marcher the primary ray
 * used. One traversal per (hit, light); movers excluded so a surface cannot
 * shadow itself (its own n·l already carries that).
 *
 * This is what makes the sun correct at OFF-SCREEN hits, which three's shadow
 * map structurally cannot do — it is view-frustum bound, and half of SRC's ray
 * hits are behind the camera or outside the frustum.
 *
 * ══ THE LIFT MOVES THE ORIGIN, SO IT MOVES `maxT` ══════════════════════════
 *
 * Plan §12.26.3, measured in the CPU mirror and fixed here from it. `maxT` is
 * supplied by the caller and is naturally measured from the SURFACE point,
 * because that is where the light's distance is known. The trace starts 0.75
 * voxels away from there, so the same world point sits at a different `t` — and
 * the emitter is the very next thing along the ray past its own `maxT`. Compare
 * the shortened distance against the unshortened budget and the shadow ray hits
 * the light itself: every light, every hit.
 *
 * The mirror measured that as **100% of the analytic emitter term lost**, on
 * three receivers, while the geometric emission path read correct values right
 * beside it — no NaN, no warning, a shadow-ray count that looks perfectly
 * healthy, and a scene that is simply black. The endpoint is recoverable from
 * `(point, toLight, maxT)` alone, so the correction needs no new binding.
 *
 * ══ AN OCCLUDER INSIDE THE LIFT IS STEPPED OVER, AND THAT IS THE MEDIUM ════
 *
 * The lift's other consequence, swept in the mirror at voxel 0.2 m: an occluder
 * closer to the surface than 0.75 · voxel loses its contact shadow, with the
 * threshold landing exactly ON the lift. Not an epsilon to tune down — a
 * smaller one re-acnes at the same voxel scale — but the DDA medium's
 * quantization showing through. The value of having the number is that a lost
 * contact shadow becomes recognizable instead of investigable.
 *
 * The two terms are DIFFERENT GEOMETRIC QUANTITIES and both are needed. The
 * lift moves the origin off the surface plane; the along-ray self-bias skips the
 * remainder of the origin's own cell, which the lift does not clear on a grazing
 * ray — 0.75 along a body-diagonal normal is only 0.43 per axis. The along-ray
 * term is the SAME quarter-cell self-bias `createSrcSceneTrace` uses, derived
 * from the same quantity (R2). Threshold: `0.75 + 0.25 = 1.0` voxel, and the
 * gate asserts exactly that sum rather than a literal.
 *
 * ⚠ **A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS COMMENT CALLED THAT PAIR "THE BIAS APPLIED
 * TWICE" AND THE 1.5-VOXEL THRESHOLD A BUG. IT WAS A MISREADING** — retracted in
 * plan §12.30.2, and the retraction is the useful part. The eye check renders the
 * two candidate values at 0.14806 and 0.14769 screen mean: a 0.25% difference,
 * i.e. noise. The along-ray bias does not measurably change the frame at 0.25 OR
 * 0.75, and a day was spent believing it had turned the scene black.
 *
 * What produced that false confirmation: `maxL` — a MAXIMUM over hits — was read
 * as a difference detector across runs of a harness that never set a camera, so
 * four different views were compared as if they were a bias sweep. Meanwhile a
 * 400k-sample grid derivation said the effect should be a ~10% RAMP and the
 * machine reported a CLIFF, and the machine was believed. R13 forbids a fix on
 * code-reading evidence; its complement belongs here — **no fix on a measurement
 * that contradicts a derivation, until the contradiction itself is resolved.**
 *
 * @param {Node} point    surface point, UNLIFTED
 * @param {Node} normal   surface normal (face-forwarded by the caller)
 * @param {Node} toLight  unit direction toward the source
 * @param {Node} [maxT]   distance to the source FROM `point`. Omitted means
 *   "as far as the medium goes" — the volume diagonal, not `Infinity`, because
 *   an unbounded literal is not a legal float in the emitted WGSL.
