// Deferred (screen-space) GI resolve.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — the architecture this replaces:
// GI used to be evaluated INSIDE every lit material's shader. The cascade
// gather and the emitter shadow traces are large pieces of code, so every
// material's fragment shader came out at 180-250kB of WGSL, and the driver
// needs 3-18 SECONDS to compile one of those. A scene's startup cost was
// therefore (materials × a multi-second driver compile), and any GI rebuild
// — a refit, a quality change, a moved bounds source — invalidated all of
// them at once. That is the whole "slow startup / freeze on change" class.
//
// Here the expensive work runs ONCE PER PIXEL instead of once per material:
//   1. a half-resolution gbuffer prepass writes world position + normal
//      (ONE override material → ONE pipeline, regardless of scene size),
//   2. a compute pass evaluates the gather + emitter direct/shadow at those
//      positions and stores the result in screen-space textures,
//   3. materials just SAMPLE those textures (see giLight) — a few lines of
//      WGSL, so material shaders stay small and, crucially, their code is
//      IDENTICAL across GI rebuilds, so rebuilds stop recompiling them.
//
// Trade-offs, deliberately accepted:
//   • Transparent surfaces are not in the gbuffer — they sample the GI of
//     whatever opaque surface is behind them.
//   • The gbuffer uses geometric/vertex normals (an override material can't
//     read each material's normal map). Diffuse GI at probe-lattice scale
//     does not resolve normal-map detail anyway.
//   • Mirror reflections stay per-material (they are view-dependent and only
//     compile for low-roughness materials).

/**
 * The resolve pass: one compute over screen pixels that turns the gbuffer
 * into the two textures materials read.
 *
 * `irradiance` — diffuse indirect (cascade gather) plus every emitter's
 * shadowed direct contribution. This is the whole diffuse GI answer, so a
 * rough material's entire GI cost becomes one texture fetch.
 *
 * `emitterShadow` — the per-emitter shadow factor (one channel per slot,
 * MAX_EMITTERS = 4) that the in-material specular glow needs. Without it,
 * glossy materials would have to re-trace shadows per pixel, which is
 * exactly the per-material cost this pass exists to remove.
 *
 * EXACT-REFLECTION HIT SHADING IS NOT HERE ANY MORE (§14 unit R-A,
 * 2026-08-22) — see `createGiBvhHitShade` below. It lived in this kernel from
 * 2026-08-02 ("binding the gather + emitter + light slots in the BVH pass asks
 * for 16 uniform buffers against a baseline of 12"), and that placement is
 * what made traced shadows at hits unshippable: the cone marcher inflated
 * THIS kernel's register footprint and the whole resolve's occupancy
 * collapsed — 5.95 → 66 ms on the user's Level, and a masked arm with ~10×
 * fewer hit pixels read the SAME 66 ms, which is the signature of a
 * whole-kernel cost, not a per-pixel one. So hits shipped UNSHADOWED at dense
 * (§12.56), and a reflected room rendered as flat, uniformly-lit albedo. The
 * uniform-buffer objection died when sceneSettings started asking the adapter
 * for 24, so the block now lives in its own pass at its own occupancy.
 *
 * `lightShadow` (optional) — GI-TRACED DIRECT SHADOWS. One occupancy shadow
 * cone per flagged analytic light slot, written to a 4-channel screen texture
 * that three's own lighting then samples through a custom `shadow.shadowNode`
 * (see GISystem's `#syncLightShadowNodes`). This is where a light's shadow gets
 * to be a real world-space trace against the same medium GI transports through,
 * instead of a shadow map — no map render, no cascade splits, no peter-panning,
 * and penumbra width that follows the light's authored angular size.
 *
 * It lives in THIS pass rather than in the materials for the same reason
 * everything else here does: one march per screen pixel per light instead of
 * one per fragment per material, and material shaders that stay a texture
 * fetch. Bundle: `{ target, slots, trace, lift, span }` — GISystem owns all of
 * them because they need the volume (trace/lift/span) and the light slots.
 *
 * `cameraPosition` IS ITS OWN INPUT, not a field of `radiance`, and that
 * separation is load-bearing rather than tidiness. Four things here need the
 * camera — the back-face `facing` flip, the gather's view bias, the reflection
 * incident ray, and (at the call site) the emitter shadow pass — while only ONE
 * of them is about reflections. It used to live inside the `radiance` bundle, so
 * a build with no cascade radiance lookup silently lost the back-face flip in
 * three surviving passes: `facing` degenerates to +1, a double-sided wall seen
 * from inside a room gathers the wrong hemisphere, and the emitter pass takes
 * its own documented `cameraPosition = null` fallback. Found while making this
 * chain survive the transport's deletion (GI_SRC_REBUILD_PLAN §12.8), where
 * `radiance` becomes null for real.
 *
 * `gather` MAY BE NULL — a build with no diffuse indirect at all (the SRC
 * rebuild's intermediate state: probes not yet populated). The diffuse term and
 * the AO that modulates it are then compiled out, not multiplied by zero, and
 * an exact-reflection hit is lit by its direct terms alone. Every other term
 * here — emitter direct, analytic direct, reflections, sun shadows — is
 * independent of it and keeps working.
 *
 * `farField` (§13 F3, optional — only passed when the detail volume is armed):
 * `{ node, worldMin, worldSize, feather }`. Surfaces outside the camera-
 * following detail box have no probes, no occupancy and no surface records —
 * without this term their indirect is an ACCIDENTAL zero (F0 measured them
 * crushed black). The term replaces the diffuse indirect with a hemispherical
 * constant — the far-field average texture × a sky-down cosine — feathered in
 * across the last `feather` metres inside the boundary. Direct sun, analytic
 * lights and their traced shadows are volume-independent and untouched; the
 * mix runs BEFORE those terms are added. `worldMin`/`worldSize` are the
 * volume's LIVE world uniforms, so every F2 slide moves the feather with the
 * box for free.

/**
 * EXACT-REFLECTION HIT SHADING, as its own pass (§14 unit R-A, 2026-08-22).
 *
 * The BVH prepass traced a reflected ray per pixel earlier this frame and
 * left `{ t, oct-normal }` + albedo in the `bvhShade` textures. This kernel
 * reconstructs each hit point and computes the reflected surface's OUTGOING
 * radiance — field gather + cone-SHADOWED emitter direct + cone-SHADOWED
 * analytic/sun direct — and stores it to `bvhShade.target`, which the mirror
 * materials sample (giLight's exact blend).
 *
 * WHY ITS OWN KERNEL, with the receipts (this block used to live in
 * createGiResolve — see the note in its header):
 * - Traced shadows at hits were measured at resolve 5.95 → 66 ms INSIDE the
 *   resolve, and the cost did not move with the hit-pixel count: register
 *   pressure from the cone marcher collapsed the whole kernel's occupancy.
 *   In its own pass the marcher prices only this dispatch.
 * - The consequence of shipping without them was the user-visible bug: at
 *   DENSE every reflected surface took FULL unshadowed sun + emitter light —
 *   "washed out solid colors without GI or any lighting" on every ultra
 *   mirror. Shadows at hits are the difference between a reflection of the
 *   room and a reflection of the room's albedo.
 * - The old 16-uniform-buffer objection to a self-contained hit pass is
 *   obsolete: sceneSettings asks the adapter for 24 (the probe capture
 *   kernel already binds this exact bundle set and runs everywhere).
 *
 * The shading formula and its diet are IDENTICAL to the reflection probe
 * capture's hit shading (reflectionProbeCapture.js) on purpose — one formula,
 * two consumers: the cone (never the record march), 24× luma trace admission,
 * 4 m emitter march cap, 6 m analytic cap. `__giHitEmitterShadows = false`
 * is the escape hatch back to unshadowed hits (now meaningful at every
 * density — it used to be the dense-mode default).
 *
 * MISS SEMANTICS ride through unchanged: alpha 0 = no hit resolved (masked
 * skip, or hit with no albedo), 1 = shaded hit, −1 = traced miss (giLight's
 * env-on-miss keys on it).
 */
/**
 * ⭐ `termMask` — THE TERM DECOMPOSITION INSTRUMENT (§18.15, 2026-08-25).
 *
 * The hit radiance is a SUM of four independently-sourced terms (field gather,
 * probe-atlas floor, emitter direct, analytic/sun direct) and a colour cast can
 * come from any of them. Reading the code has now produced FOUR wrong answers
 * about one green cast, because every term is individually plausible and none
 * of them is individually observable — `bvhRadiance` only ever shows the sum.
 *
 * `termMask` is a vec4 uniform, one scalar per term in that order, that scales
 * each term where it enters. Set it to (1,0,0,0) and the readback IS the gather
 * term; (0,0,1,0) and it is the emitter term alone. One build, four arms, no
 * rebuild between them — which is the whole point: an A/B that costs a 50 s
 * Bistro rebuild per arm does not get run.
 *
 * It is BUILD-TIME OPT-IN (`null` here → not a single node emitted), so the
 * shipping graph is byte-identical to the pre-instrument one and this cannot
 * become a silent 4-multiply tax on every reflected pixel.

/**
 * SCREEN-SPACE AMBIENT OCCLUSION, as its own pass — the successor to the
 * resolve's inlined occupancy-oracle ladder (2026-08-21).
 *
 * The oracle ladder was the right idea priced out of existence twice over:
 * §13.7f measured a build that NEVER FINISHED compiling with it on (~200
 * occupancy fetches inlined per resolve pixel — §13.14's "WGSL size buys
 * compile seconds", bought four times), and §13.7d showed it structurally
 * cannot darken below its own 2-voxel self-surface allowance (0.7 m at
 * default cells) — which is exactly the contact scale AO exists for.
 *
 * This pass reads the gbuffer instead: THREE golden-spiral rings of WORLD
 * POSITION taps around each pixel (22 total — a WIDE ring at the authored
 * radius for corner and crevice shading, a CONTACT ring at a quarter of it
 * whose own falloff normalization keeps centimetre-scale darkening crisp
 * under feet and furniture, and a MICRO ring pinned at a fixed few PIXELS
 * that is the only one able to see two meshes touching at distance — see its
 * note below), Alchemy-style horizon estimate against the camera-faced
 * normal. The three rings combine by the multiplicative union
 * 1-(1-w)(1-c)(1-m) — each deepens what the others cannot resolve, bounded by
 * 1 — and a ^1.5 curve on the result deepens
 * creases without touching open surfaces. World-space vectors from exact
 * positions, so the self-surface allowance problem does not exist here —
 * contact darkening starts at centimetres. The classic screen-space blind
 * spot (off-screen occluders) is accepted: this term only ever REMOVES
 * light from the indirect estimate, and a missed occluder degrades to
 * exactly the pre-AO image.
 *
 * The kernel is ~30 lines of WGSL and two texture bindings — the compile
 * cost that killed the oracle simply is not here. The IGN rotation is a pure
 * function of the pixel coordinate, so the pattern is STABLE across frames:
 * no temporal noise, no filter debt. It modulates the INDIRECT term only
 * (the resolve applies it before the direct terms are added), same contract
 * as the ladder it replaces.
 *
 * `strength`/`radius` are the same live uniforms the old block bound
 * (`__giAoOverride` keeps working); `projScale` converts the world radius to
 * a screen tap radius (0.5 · resolveHeight · proj[1][1], written per frame
 * beside the resolve camera).

/**
 * RAY-TRACED AMBIENT OCCLUSION — AO FROM THE CASCADE'S OWN TRACER (2026-08-26).
 *
 * Replaces BOTH previous estimators, on a user directive ("abandon vxao and
 * gtao, for gi ao, reuse our Radiance Cascade traces"). What each of them was
 * and why neither survives:
 *
 *   · `createGiAoPass` — three screen-space spirals over the gbuffer. It can
 *     only see what is ON SCREEN and it estimates occlusion from a depth
 *     buffer, which is a heightfield and not the scene. 4.31 ms measured.
 *   · `createGiVxaoPass` — six 60-degree cones through the occupancy density
 *     pyramid. Correct in world space and blind below a level-1 cell, because
 *     that is the finest medium it has. **10.94 ms measured — the single most
 *     expensive pass in the whole SRC chain.**
 *
 * Both are approximations of one integral that this module can now evaluate
 * DIRECTLY: the cascade's own ray budget already runs against a masked static
 * BVH8 of exact world triangles (`dynamicObjects.traceStaticBvh`), plus the
 * exact dynamic set. So AO stops being a separate estimator with its own
 * failure modes and becomes the same visibility question the transport already
 * answers, asked per PIXEL instead of per probe.
 *
 * ══ WHY THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS GATHERING THE CASCADE'S STORED VISIBILITY ══
 *
 * Every c0 bin already stores `BIN_T`, the fraction of rays through that
 * direction that passed unblocked, and the gather's irradiance was integrated
 * from those same rays — so the occlusion is ALREADY in the gather, at PROBE
 * LATTICE resolution (0.70 m on the user's Sponza). Re-deriving AO from that
 * field and multiplying it back in would add no detail and darken twice. The
 * whole reason an AO term exists here is the sub-lattice band the probe grid
 * cannot resolve, and only a per-PIXEL query reaches it. That is this pass.
 *
 * ══ THE RADIUS IS DERIVED FROM THE CASCADE, NOT AUTHORED ═══════════════════
 *
 * `intervalBoundary(0, 0, s0) = s0 · R0_OVER_S0` is the distance cascade 0
 * resolves per probe. Four of those is the reach — which lands at 2.24 m on
 * the user's Sponza, within 12% of the 2.0 m the retired VXAO shipped, except
 * that this one is a function of what the scene measures rather than a metre
 * constant. That is the standing rule about world-unit constants, applied to
 * the one number this pass has.
 *
 * ══ WHAT MAKES FOUR RAYS ENOUGH ════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * · COSINE-WEIGHTED sampling, so `1 - mean(occluded)` IS the cosine-weighted
 *   visibility integral. No cosine factor, no bias term, no falloff curve
 *   standing in for one.
 * · STRATIFIED: ray k draws its radius from `[k/N, (k+1)/N)`, so the rays
 *   cannot clump. Only the offset inside each stratum is per-pixel.
 * · A STATIC pattern (no `frame` term). The same argument the retired screen
 *   pass made and then failed to honour: a per-pixel rotation is a per-pixel
 *   estimator, and its disagreement is spatial noise. The difference is that
 *   this pass is FOLLOWED by the separable cross-bilateral, which turns a
 *   5x5 neighbourhood of decorrelated 4-ray estimates into ~100 samples. A
 *   temporally-animated pattern would need a history buffer to pay off and
 *   would shimmer without one.
 * · A STOCHASTIC PER-RAY RANGE in [0.55R, R]. `anyHit` returns the first
 *   blocker rather than the nearest, so its `t` cannot drive an exact falloff
 *   curve — but jittering the ray's own tMax makes the ENSEMBLE a smooth ramp
 *   over that band, in expectation exactly. Free, and it is what stops a hard
 *   "AO ends here" ring on large surfaces.
 *
 * ══ THE BIAS IS SLOPE-SCALED, AND IT HAS TO BE ═════════════════════════════
 *
 * Cosine sampling puts most rays near the normal but the tail arbitrarily
 * close to the tangent plane, where an interpolated shading normal and the
 * true triangle diverge most — the classic RTAO dark-banding artifact. `d·N`
 * is `sqrt(1-u1)`, already computed for the direction, so scaling the offset
 * by `1/max(d·N, 0.15)` costs one divide and removes it. Against exact
 * triangles the offset is millimetres, not the 1.5 voxels a DDA needs (see
 * the static-BVH arm's note in GISystem: that inherited voxel bias was the
 * measured cause of "holes in the shadows").

 * ⭐ GTAO — GROUND TRUTH AMBIENT OCCLUSION (2026-08-26, user: "could we get
 * back to GTAO in our GI AO solution? just make it right and good").
 *
 * WHAT "GROUND TRUTH" ACTUALLY MEANS HERE, because the name is the reason to
 * prefer it and it is routinely read as a marketing word. Every other AO this
 * module has shipped estimated occlusion with a HEURISTIC — count the rays
 * that hit (RTAO), accumulate density along a cone (VXAO), sum an
 * artist-shaped falloff per tap (the old spirals). GTAO instead SOLVES the
 * cosine-weighted visibility integral in closed form over the horizon angles
 * it measures (Jimenez et al., "Practical Realtime Strategies for Accurate
 * Indirect Occlusion", SIGGRAPH 2016). Given the same horizons, its answer is
 * the analytically correct one — no falloff curve to tune, no strength that
 * secretly means "how wrong am I willing to be". That is why this term has no
 * knobs, and it is the reason to run it in a module whose standing rule is
 * that GI has three properties.
 *
 * THE INTEGRAL, per slice, so the code below reads as maths:
 *
 *   A slice is the plane through the view vector V and one screen-space
 *   direction ω. Marching ω left and right and keeping the largest
 *   cos(angle to V) on each side gives the two HORIZON angles h₀, h₁ that
 *   bound the unoccluded arc in that plane. Projecting the surface normal
 *   into the same plane gives its in-plane angle γ and its length |n| (the
 *   share of the hemisphere this slice is entitled to). The cosine-weighted
 *   visibility of that arc is then, exactly,
 *
 *     ¼·|n|·Σ_{h ∈ {h₀,h₁}} ( cos γ + 2·h·sin γ − cos(2h − γ) )
 *
 *   and AO is the mean over slices. `cos γ` is `cosNorm` below and is never
 *   recomputed from γ — γ is derived FROM it by an arccos.
 *
 * WHY IT COMES BACK AFTER THE RAY-TRACED ARM. That arm is not wrong: it is
 * world-space correct and it sees off-screen geometry. But its cost is the
 * rays and only the rays (measured: ~10 ns each, and neither the reach nor
 * the dynamic-set traversal moved it), so the whole budget bought ONE ray per
 * pixel plus a 7×7 filter to hide the variance — and one ray is a binary
 * sample of a continuous integral. A GTAO slice is not a sample of anything:
 * it reads a horizon, the EXTREME over its entire march, and integrates it in
 * closed form. Three slices over 24 gbuffer loads therefore carry far more of
 * the answer than one ray does, for less, and they produce a smooth field
 * rather than a denoised one.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TRADE IS REAL AND IT IS SCREEN-SPACE: an occluder outside the frustum,
 * or hidden behind the surface it should darken, does not exist to this pass.
 * That is acceptable *here specifically* and nowhere else — the resolve
 * multiplies this factor into the GATHER term only, and the cascade's own
 * BIN_T visibility already carries every world-space blocker at probe-lattice
 * resolution (0.70 m on the user's Sponza). The whole job of an AO term in
 * this module is the SUB-LATTICE band, and that band is by construction
 * within a few pixels of the receiving pixel — exactly where a depth buffer
 * is a faithful description of the world. `__giAoRaytraced = true` restores
 * the ray-traced arm for an A/B.
 *
 * ⛔ NO TEMPORAL. Standing user directive, and GTAO normally ships WITH a
 * 6-frame temporal rotation — that half is deliberately not taken. The
 * cheaper tiers use Jimenez's 4×4 SPATIAL idea (16 slice rotations × 4 step
 * offsets over a 4×4 pixel tile), jittered inside each cell and reconstructed
 * by the existing separable bilateral. Ultra instead evaluates five centred
 * slices at every full-resolution pixel and keeps only the four stable
 * radial strata across neighbours. Its angular error is smooth quadrature
 * error, while the filter resolves the radial phases without temporal history.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY CONSTANT HERE IS A FRACTION OR A PIXEL COUNT — never a metre.
 * `radius` arrives derived from the cascade (see #armGtaoPass), the falloff
 * opens at a FRACTION of it, and the screen reach is clamped in pixels and as
 * a fraction of the frame height. Metre constants are the class this module
 * has now retracted three times.

/**
 * THE SCREEN-AO DENOISER (2026-08-26, "the ao is quite bad quality still,
 * especially screen space component").
 *
 * WHAT THE GRAIN IS. `createGiAoPass` rotates its three golden-angle spirals
 * by interleaved-gradient noise — a DIFFERENT angle at every pixel. Its header
 * calls that pattern "stable across frames: no temporal noise, no filter debt",
 * and the first half is true: nothing here flickers. The second half is not.
 * A per-pixel rotation is a per-pixel ESTIMATOR, so neighbouring pixels
 * integrate different subsets of the same hemisphere and disagree — that
 * disagreement is spatial noise whether or not it moves, and nothing
 * downstream was removing it. It is worst in the MICRO ring, which draws 10
 * taps from the ~28 pixels inside a 3 px disc and is then multiplied by 3.
 *
 * Every shipping SSAO pairs a rotated kernel with a spatial denoiser for
 * exactly this reason; the rotation is what trades BANDING for noise, and the
 * filter is the other half of that trade. (Dropping the rotation instead is
 * what the pass did before, and it printed angular sectors around round props
 * — see the TAPS_WIDE note. The pair is the answer, not either half.)
 *
 * SEPARABLE, AND CROSS-BILATERAL ON THE PLANE ONLY. Two radius-2 passes cover
 * a 5x5 support for 10 taps instead of 25. The edge test is the receiver's own
 * plane — |dot(N, tapP - P)| — and NOT a normal comparison, because the plane
 * test already rejects the perpendicular face of a corner (its distance from
 * the centre plane grows immediately) while costing one texture read per tap
 * instead of two. AO is a smooth 0..1 factor, so a tap that fails the test is
 * dropped and the weights renormalize; there is no fallback-to-unoccluded that
 * could print a bright halo at a silhouette.
 *
 * ⚠ THE TOLERANCE IS IN PIXEL FOOTPRINTS, NOT METRES. A fixed world epsilon
 * is the constant class this module keeps retracting: at 2 m it rejects a
 * floor's own neighbours, at 40 m it accepts a different wall. `dist /
 * projScale` is the world size of one pixel at this depth, so 4 of them is
 * "about as far as a 2-tap-radius neighbour can legitimately be", at every
 * distance and every field of view.

/**
 * WORLD-SPACE VOXEL AO — VXAO, in the NVIDIA sense: a cone-traced integral of
 * the hemisphere against a voxel opacity pyramid.
 *
 * The occupancy field already owns the expensive half: conservative scene
 * voxelization plus a five-level FRACTIONAL-density hierarchy. This pass only
 * traces it from visible gbuffer points. It deliberately lives outside the
 * resolve so the occupancy `bits` storage buffer is bound in this small kernel
 * alone; the fully-composed resolve stays under WebGPU's portable
 * eight-storage-buffer limit.
 *
 * THE CONE SET is Crassin's, which is also what VXGI/VXAO ship: six cones of
 * 60° aperture — one along the normal, five at 60° elevation spaced 72° in
 * azimuth — weighted by the cosine of their elevation, so the sum is a
 * cosine-weighted hemisphere integral rather than an unweighted average.
 *
 * NOTHING IS RANDOMISED. The previous arm rotated the azimuth per pixel with
 * interleaved-gradient noise and had no temporal or spatial filter behind it,
 * so the rotation was a per-pixel bias, not an ensemble that averages. Six wide
 * overlapping cones over a CONTINUOUS medium vary so little with azimuth that a
 * fixed frame costs almost nothing in bias and buys an exactly reproducible,
 * noise-free field — which is what a term reconstructed by a 2×2 bilateral
 * upsample needs. The frame is Duff et al.'s branchless orthonormal basis: it
 * has no `up`-vector flip, so it cannot print a seam where one axis dominates.
 *
 * `traceConeAO` is occupancyField.traceOccupancyConeAO — read its header for
 * why the estimator, not the filtering, is where AO smoothness is won.
 *
 * RESOLUTION. This term is metre-scale by construction (its finest medium is a
 * level-1 cell and its cones open at 60°), so it is computed at half width and
 * height and reconstructed by the resolve's position/normal-weighted bilinear
 * upsample. `createGiAoPass` remains responsible for exact screen-space
 * contacts below the voxel scale; the resolve composes them with `min`.

 * on purpose: the same `vector` convention, the same `dist - lift` reach,
 * the same k = 1/angularRadius penumbra. Two terms that disagree about a
 * light's shadow read as the indirect bounce and the direct light coming
 * from different suns.
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE PASS: the trace behind this texture is the most expensive
 * per-pixel work the module does (~5-7ns/px measured on the user's Sponza —
 * ~10ms of the 4×-pixel Play frame), and nothing ties its resolution to the
 * gather resolve's: the texture is sampled only by materials, through the
 * position-validated bilateral that already reconstructs full-res edges.
 * Its pixel count is therefore its own budget (GISystem #lightShadowSize),
 * and the gbuffer is read at nearest-texel through the resolution ratio.

 * shared with the resolve's hit-shading path) at the SHADOW pixel budget,
 * writes the raw 4-channel result, and the edge-aware filter pass averages
 * it into `emitterShadow` — which also gives the emitter channel the
 * spatial filter it never had (a good part of the coarse-preset
 * blockiness). The resolve and materials then just sample the texture.
 *
 * `cameraPosition` (optional) reproduces the resolve's facing flip so both
 * kernels shade the same side of double-sided geometry; without a camera
 * the raw gbuffer normal is used, exactly like the resolve's own fallback.
 *
 * `distTarget` (optional, 2026-08-13) is the ANALYTIC-PENUMBRA channel: one
 * world-space penumbra HALF-WIDTH in metres per slot, computed from the
 * blocker distance the static-BVH trace already returns (see GISystem's
 * #buildEmitterRecordTrace). It exists only on the arm whose trace advertises
 * `withPenumbra`; with the width-probe arm the marcher carries softness in
 * the shadow value itself and this channel would be all zeros.

/**
 * §12.70 W4b — THE PER-TILE EMITTER CUT. One thread per TILE of the
 * emitter-shadow grid: reconstruct the tile-centre receiver from the gbuffer
 * (the same load + facing flip the shadow pass applies per pixel), rank EVERY
 * light-tree emitter record by `clusterImportance` at that receiver, keep the
 * top MAX_EMITTERS. Deterministic — no draws, no history; the selection can
 * only change when the scene or the camera does.
 *
 * ⚠ CHANNEL KEYING IS BY EMITTER ID, NOT BY RANK. The kept 4 are sorted
 * ascending by id before writing, so wherever two adjacent tiles agree on the
 * SET, they agree on every channel's meaning — at ≤4 emitters that is
 * everywhere, which is what makes the future consumer swap byte-comparable
 * to the global slots. Rank order is deliberately discarded: it is the one
 * thing neighbouring tiles are ALLOWED to disagree on without artifacts.
 *
 * An emitter whose importance is ZERO at the tile centre is excluded even if
 * seats are free (strict `>` against an empty slot's 0): the emission-cone /
 * behind-horizon cases the importance already prices. Empty seats read
 * 0xffffffff. A sky tile (no geometry) writes an all-empty list, valid 0.
 *
 * O(N) scan, not a tree walk, ON PURPOSE: tiles number thousands (not
 * millions of pixels), records max out at 127/leaf, and one inlined
 * importance inside a GPU loop beats a best-first traversal's stack at every
 * N the block can hold. The TREE remains [J]'s sampling structure (§12.69);
 * the screen needs only the ranking key — `createLightTreeEmitterImportance`,
 * the same `buildImportanceMath` the descent compiles.
 *
 * Consumerless in this slice: the rig reads `posBuf`/`idBuf` back and
 * verifies the sets against the CPU's `emitterImportance` at the SAME
 * reconstructed P (§12.70 W4b gate). emitterShadowPass/emitterDirectAt swap
 * onto `idBuf` in the next slice.
 *
 * @param {(P,N,hasN,base,id)=>Node} options.importance

    // ⚠ THE WEIGHT IS PER EMITTER, NOT PER RANK, AND THAT DISTINCTION IS THE
    // WHOLE FIX. Fading only rank 3 was the obvious version and it was
    // MEASURED (feather 0.5, 24 lamps): the seam's median fell ×3 (Δchroma at
    // a set change 0.0738 → 0.0243) but the CONTROL — boundaries where the set
    // does NOT change — got worse, p90 0.037 → 0.070. A weight attached to a
    // RANK jumps when two kept members merely trade places: X at rank 2 has
    // weight 1 and at rank 3 has weight w, so a 2↔3 swap steps the image by
    // (1−w)·(L_X − L_Y) while the SET never changed. That is a seam the census
    // files under setDiff 0, which is exactly where it showed up.
    //
    // A weight that is a function of the emitter's OWN importance has no such
    // hole: at ANY crossing the two emitters involved have EQUAL importance by
    // definition of a crossing, so they have equal weight, so exchanging them
    // changes nothing. Every pairwise discontinuity in the cut closes at once.

    // continuous in P for the same reason: it is an order statistic of

    // scale is bounded by the slot count (wRaw_k ≤ Σ wRaw so w_k ≤ 4), and the

 * 21-tap (5×5 minus corners) cross-bilateral at shadow resolution, weights
 * from the RECEIVER PLANE (gbuffer position/normal) so penumbras smooth along
 * a surface but never bleed across silhouettes or depth steps. `planeEps` is
 * the plane-distance tolerance — half an occupancy voxel, the medium's own
 * quantization, passed as a node so a refit rescales it.
 *
 * Filtering happens HERE, at the shadow pass's own budgeted resolution, not
 * in materials: every gi light's compiled shadow branch samples the filtered
 * texture through the existing position-validated bilateral upsample, so the

/**
 * WIDE PENUMBRA RECONSTRUCTION for the direct-shadow channel (2026-08-06).
 *
 * The analytic-width estimator softens the MISS side of a silhouette; the
 * central-ray HIT boundary is binary, and at large source angles that reads
 * as a hard edge inside the smoothed penumbra (user report at 30°, then
 * again at 90°). The material-side PCSS disc cannot fix it alone: its
 * radius is capped at 24 half-res texels (a 90° sun wants 3-4× that) and
 * spending more taps there costs every lit pixel of every material. This
 * pass does the wide blur ONCE, at the shadow channel's own budgeted
 * resolution: per-pixel penumbra width = tan(source half-angle) × blocker
 * distance (the march's own occluder distance, deterministic), radius up
 * to 40 shadow-res texels, a per-pixel IGN-rotated 12-tap golden spiral
 * whose taps contribute per-channel only within that channel's radius,
 * with receiver-plane validity so silhouettes don't cross-bleed. Sub-texel
 * radii keep the sharp result bit-exact, so a 0° sun is untouched.
 *
 * Point lights keep radius 0 for now (their angular size is per-pixel;
 * same deliberate deferral as the material disc).
 *
 * WORLD-WIDTH MODE (`slots: null`, 2026-08-13) — how the EMITTER channel uses
 * this same pass. Area emitters have no single source angle to reconstruct a
 * width from (it is per-pixel: reff/dist), so their marcher stores the
 * finished penumbra HALF-WIDTH IN METRES in the dist channel and this pass
 * only projects it to texels. That removes `span`, `tanHalf`, `slot.kind` and
 * the whole slot table from the emitter arm's bindings — the radius is one
 * multiply. `searchFrac` widens the blocker search to match the pass's own
 * radius cap: a pass that may blur by r texels has to look r texels out for
 * the blocker, or the penumbra clips at the geometric silhouette instead of
 * spanning both sides of it (the light arm's fixed 3 texels is sized for a
 * marcher that already softened the miss side; the emitter arm's raw is a
 * hard binary hit).
 *
 * ── THE WORLD→TEXEL MAP IS THE CAMERA'S, NOT A CONSTANT (2026-08-19) ────────
 * `projScale` is `P[5]/2` from the live projection matrix: a world half-width
 * `w` at depth `d` covers exactly `w·P[5]/(2d)` of the frame HEIGHT. It used to
 * be a hard-coded 1.2, which is that term at a 45° camera and nothing else — a
 * 60° view over-blurred by 1.39×, a 74° view by 1.8×. That is a bug you cannot
 * see as "wrong softness", only as "the shadow got weaker when I changed the
 * view", and it is half of the measured 2× over-blur that turned a full umbra
 * into 35% grey (scripts/run-gi-shadow-viewdist-probe.mjs).
 *
 * `radiusScale` is the other half. TWO CHAINED DISC BLURS OF RADIUS r ARE NOT
 * A BLUR OF RADIUS r — variances add, so the pair behaves like a single disc of
 * r·√2. The chain exists for SAMPLE COUNT (16 taps over 16-tap-averaged data ≈
 * 256 effective), not for width, so each instance takes 1/√2 of the analytic
 * width and the composite lands on the width the penumbra model actually asked
 * for. Callers that WANT the compounding (the 90° sun) simply leave it at 1.

/**
 * ══ THE IRRADIANCE TEMPORAL FILTER (§12.65) ═════════════════════════════════
 *
 * A reprojected screen-space EMA over the GI resolve — the "resolve-space
 * filter" §12.63 specced after the Sponza probes measured what no CPU dial
 * could reach: post-pan holds churn at 16× the parked floor because the
 * screen-driven transport re-samples every probe when the view changes, and
 * the whole field crawls to its new equilibrium IN VIEW. The probes' own
 * temporal layer cannot help (it is the thing converging); a second, SCREEN
 * layer can, because the resolve's per-pixel answer for a parked-or-panning
 * camera over static geometry is the same world radiance landing on
 * reprojectable pixels.
 *
 * Shape: `raw` is the resolve's output (the filter's OWN input texture,
 * never sampled by materials); history is validated EXACTLY like the
 * light-shadow filter's — previous camera's clip, row-flipped, world-position
 * epsilon, 3×3 silhouette rescue (that pass's comments carry the measured
 * reasons; this one inherits them wholesale). The blend writes `target` =
 * `targets.irradiance`, the texture materials have always sampled.
 *
 * Ghosting control is the SHADOW CHAIN'S, not a neighborhood clamp: the
 * `history.weight` uniform is driven to zero by the system while any LIGHT
 * is moving (matrix, luminance or emitter motion — the same family the α
 * ramp rides), because a light change invalidates history SEMANTICALLY
 * (same surface, stale radiance) in a way position validation cannot see.
 * Camera motion deliberately does NOT drop the weight — reprojection handles
 * it, and that is the entire point: the pan's re-equilibration churn averages
 * away instead of playing on screen. Validation failure falls back to the
 * raw resolve — the failure mode is the pre-§12.65 noise, never a ghost.

 * distance (miss = -1) into a screen texture. giLight's mirror block
 * samples this by screen UV INSTEAD OF calling the SDF `mirrorTraceFn` when
 * `light.bvhReflectTexture` is set — everything downstream of the hit
 * distance (hit shading, per-hit shadows) is unchanged; only the t SOURCE
 * moves from a per-material SDF trace to this shared compute pass.
 *
 * BVH tracing happens ONLY here (a compute pass), never inside a material:
 * the traversal needs 4 storage buffers plus a per-mesh uniform table, and
 * materials already sit at the 8-storage-buffer fragment-stage limit (see
 * docs/GI_PLAN.md Phase 3 and the dead 2026-07-16 ReSTIR attempt that first

 * BVH traversal every frame whether or not a single reflective surface was
 * visible, which is the whole of the "exact reflections are super expensive"
 * report. The gbuffer's second attachment now carries a mirror mask in its w
 * (see createGiGBuffer's `maskMrtNode`), and non-mirror threads exit before
 * `firstHit`. They still WRITE, with t = -1 / hasAlbedo = 0, so a material
 * that samples a masked-off texel gets the ordinary miss semantics and falls
 * back to the cascade lookup — the output is identical, only the cost moves.
 * `mask: false` restores the dense behaviour (the A/B arm).
 *
 * This pass TRACES ONLY — it writes geometry (hit t, face normal, hit albedo),
 * never light. Shading the hit needs the cascade gather, the emitter slots and
 * the analytic light slots, and binding those HERE asks for 16 uniform buffers
 * in one compute stage against a WebGPU baseline of 12 (measured, and the
 * emitter bundle is the part that blows it). The resolve pass already binds all

  // Sponza (`profile.giPasses`, 1588×898) — 41 % of the frame, and by far the
  // most expensive thing GI does. It was invisible for three sessions because
  // it was missing from that op's pass list.
  //
  // A BVH traversal per pixel is what costs; the STORES are nearly free. So
  // trace one ray per block and replicate the result across the block, which
  // keeps every target full-resolution and therefore needs NO change in any
  // consumer — the resolve reads these with `load(coord)` on its own full-res
  // grid (createGiResolve's `bvhShade`) and materials sample by `screenUV`. A
  // genuinely half-res TEXTURE would have required touching both.
  //
  // Replication is VALIDATED, not blind: each neighbour's gbuffer position and
  // normal are compared against the traced texel's, and a texel that fails
  // (the block straddles a silhouette) is written as a MISS rather than given
  // its neighbour's hit distance. That matters because the consumer
  // reconstructs the hit point from this `t` and its OWN normal — a wrong `t`
  // puts the reflected sample somewhere else entirely, which is the bright
  // smear half-res reflections are known for. A miss is not a hole: it is the
  // same value a masked-off pixel gets, and the material falls back to the
  // cascade lookup exactly as it does everywhere else.
  //
  // MEASURED on the banner Sponza at 1588×898: 13.09 ms per-pixel → 4.23 ms at
  // stride 2 → 3.84 ms at stride 3. The curve flattens because the validation
  // taps and the stores grow with the block while only the TRACES shrink, so
  // stride 3 is the practical floor; past it the block starts spanning enough
  // surface that the position/normal check rejects most neighbours and the
  // reflection quietly degrades to the cascade lookup for no further speed.

  // `radianceDiv: 3` was measured and chosen against a FIXED 1.6 M-pixel ultra
  // resolve, where it yields ~178 k radiance texels — about 3.2x linear
  // magnification onto a 1.88 M-pixel screen, which the hardware bilinear
  // carries. The frame governor (engine/frameGovernor.js) now scales the
  // resolve itself, and a constant divisor turns into a QUALITY CLIFF the
  // moment it does: at governor rung 3 the resolve is 592 k, the radiance grid
  // is 65 k, and one reflection sample covers a 5.4 x 5.4 SCREEN BLOCK.
  //
  // That is a user-visible bug, reported as "reflections look incredibly
  // shitty" with a screenshot of a Vespa whose chrome was blocky red/white/
  // black speckle. Two multiplications of the same reduction stacked: the
  // governor's, and this one.
  //
  // So solve for the divisor that HOLDS the shipped magnification instead of
  // holding the shipped divisor.
  //
  // ⚠⚠ FRACTIONAL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE TRICK. The first attempt rounded to an
  // integer and its own gate rejected it: an integer step from 3 to 2
  // multiplies radiance texels by 2.25 while one governor rung only removes
  // 28%, so texels went UP between rung 1 and rung 2. That breaks the ladder's
  // monotonicity in cost, which is far worse than the blockiness it fixes — the
  // governor would descend a rung, measure a SLOWER frame, and descend again
  // into a loop it can never win. A fractional divisor is safe because nothing
  // downstream reads it: `createGiBvhHitShade` derives its mapping as
  // `resolveWidth / radianceWidth` from the ACTUAL texture dimensions, and
  // snaps that to the prepass stride (see its own banner on the 3-vs-2 beat).
  //
  // ⚠ CLAMPED AT 2 ON THE CHEAP SIDE, also load-bearing: without it a small
  // resolve solves below 1 and the radiance grid ends up LARGER than it was at
  // full quality. Div >= 2 keeps radiance texels <= resolve/4 at every rung, so
  // cost falls with the rung even where magnification can no longer be held.
  //
  // At full-quality ultra this returns exactly 3.0 — the shipped value,
  // unchanged, which is the point: it only engages where the governor has

 * could not draw — overwhelmingly KTX2/Basis-compressed material maps, which
 * have no CPU-readable `.image` for `ctx.drawImage` to sample (see that
 * function's own comment). The compute shader that actually SAMPLES the
 * atlas (bvhScene.js `firstHit`) has no such limitation: a compressed
 * texture is real, native GPU data, decoded by the sampler hardware exactly
 * like any other texture — the only reason those tiles were ever a flat
 * mean color is that the CANVAS couldn't see the pixels, not that the GPU
 * can't.
 *
 * One-shot per bvhScene build, entirely self-guarding: a no-op whenever
 * `bvhScene.pendingGpuTiles` is empty, which is true both BEFORE the first
 * call that has real work to do and forever AFTER that call finishes (it
 * clears the list). Callers (GISystem's `#tick`) can therefore call this
 * every frame unconditionally — see that call site's own comment.
 *
 * MECHANISM: two kinds of ordinary textured-quad passes (three's own
 * QuadMesh — the exact idiom every postprocessing pass in this three.js
 * build uses to relay one texture into another render target) into a fresh
 * 2048x2048 target: first the EXISTING canvas atlas whole (so every
 * already-drawn/solid-filled tile survives unchanged), then one quad per
 * pending tile with the viewport+scissor restricted to that tile's 256x256
 * rect, sampling the compressed map directly. Renderer state is saved and
 * restored via three's own RendererUtils — the same helper three's
 * postprocessing nodes use for exactly this "nested render mid-frame" shape
 * (renderGiGBuffer above hand-rolls the same idea for a narrower, scene/
 * camera-specific set of fields; this pass only ever touches the renderer).
 *
 * COLOR SPACE: the destination target is declared LINEAR colorSpace
 * (HalfFloatType has no `-srgb` GPU format variant to begin with, so this
 * is belt-and-braces, not load-bearing, for THAT type specifically — but it
 * is the semantically correct label and keeps the invariant explicit).
 * `texture(atlasTexture)`/`texture(map)` sampling auto-decodes each SOURCE
 * (both declared SRGBColorSpace, like any authored color texture) to linear
 * exactly once, at the GPU-format level — this renderer never bakes a
 * second, shader-side color-space conversion on top (see TextureNode's
 * `needsToWorkingColorSpace` callers: always format/hardware-driven here,
 * never WGSL-codegen-driven), so the linear value sampled is exactly the
 * linear value stored, and exactly the linear value read back later with no
 * further decode. A solid-fill tile therefore reads the SAME color before
 * and after this pass runs (old atlas, sRGB-decoded once → stored linear →
 * new target, read with no decode) — that equivalence is the whole
 * color-space correctness bar for this function, and is what makes swapping
 * `atlasTextureNode.value` afterward safe without rebuilding bvhScene's
 * already-compiled compute graph.
