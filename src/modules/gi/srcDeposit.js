// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — [E] the split scatter, [F] the resolve.
//
// One ray, traced once, deposited into EVERY cascade of its pixel's ancestor
// chain. That is the "split" in Split Radiance Cascades and it is why no cascade
// ever traces its own rays: the cascades below the hit each learn "this
// direction was clear through my interval", the cascade OWNING the hit learns
// what was there, and nothing above it learns anything at all.
//
// `srcMath.js`'s `splitDeposits` is the mirror and its header carries the rule
// this file must not get wrong:
//
//   d in cascade k  →  cascades 0..k-1 get (L = 0, T = 1)
//                      cascade  k       gets (L = hit radiance, T = 0)
//                      cascades k+1..   get NOTHING
//   a miss          →  every cascade gets (L = 0, T = 1)
//
// **Nothing is deposited above the owning cascade.** The companion guide has
// this wrong; the authors rejected upward extension for bias. And the sky is not
// deposited here either — it composites once at the top of the merge, because a
// per-cascade sky deposit multiplies it by the cascade count.
//
// ══ WHY THE ACCUMULATORS ARE FIXED POINT, AND WHAT F=16 BOUGHT ══════════════
//
// WGSL has no float atomics, so radiance accumulates as `round(L/Lmax · 2^F)`.
// §12.13.4 measured the headroom: bins average **0.78 rays/bin at every
// cascade** (the probes÷4 and bins×4 per level cancel), and F=16 overflows only
// at 65,536 saturated rays in ONE bin — about 84,000× the measured average.
//
// TRANSMITTANCE AND COUNT ARE FIXED POINT TOO — but only since the temporal
// blend, and for a reason that has nothing to do with precision. Every deposit's
// T is exactly 0 or 1, so before Phase 4 `sumT` was an integer count of clear
// deposits and `T = sumT/count` was exact with no scale at all. Then the decay
// arrived, and `floor(1 · 0.9) = 0`: a count of ONE — which at 0.78 rays/bin is
// the common case, not the corner — would drop to zero on the very next frame
// and the bin would go back to UNKNOWN having just been sampled. So both words
// carry `DEPOSIT_F` fractional bits, the same as radiance, and they are no
// longer counts but WEIGHTS. The scale then cancels out of `L = ΣR/Σcount`
// exactly (`toL` is `Lmax/count`, with no `2^F` in it at all), so the resolve
// got simpler rather than more complicated.
//
// ══ THE TEMPORAL BLEND LIVES HERE, NOT ON THE RESOLVED PAYLOAD ══════════════
//
// Plan §4.1 [F] put it on the payload — "temporal blend with resident probe
// history" — and §4.2 sized `binPayload` to match, as "the resolved payload plus
// the pre-averaged cone mirror written by the merge". [G] then merged IN PLACE
// (§12.20.1, worth 22 MB), which means the resolved payload does not survive its
// own frame: by the time the next frame could blend against it, the merge has
// overwritten it with `own + T · parent`.
//
// **Blending the merged payload in place is not merely inelegant, it multiplies
// the parent's light by 1/α.** With `H ← (1−α)H + αS` and then `H ← H + T·P`,
// the fixed point is `H = L + T·P/α` — at α = 0.1 the whole cascade above a
// probe arrives ten times over. The alternative that keeps the plan's placement
// is a second payload buffer, giving back exactly the 22 MB [G] saved.
//
// So the blend moves one stage EARLIER, onto the accumulators, where it is
// better on three counts and worse on none:
//
//   1. **It weights by EVIDENCE.** A payload EMA gives one frame's single ray
//      the same weight as another frame's twenty. Decaying the sums and the
//      count together makes `ΣR/Σcount` an exponentially-weighted mean over
//      RAYS. At §12.13.4's measured 0.78 rays/bin this is the difference
//      between an average and a lottery.
//   2. **It needs no warmup path.** See `TEMPORAL_ALPHA` in srcConfig — a fresh
//      block's sums are zero, so its first frame resolves to that frame's own
//      rays, at full weight, with nothing to crawl up from. R6 for free.
//   3. **α = 1 is the code, not a branch.** `keep = 0` zeroes every word, which
//      is precisely the clear pass this replaced. Single-frame mode — §4.6's
//      quality-gate configuration — is one uniform, and every single-frame gate
//      in the suite is unaffected whatever α is set to, because frame one has no
//      history either way.
//
// It costs a read where the clear only wrote, and one word per bin block (the
// claim stamp, in the probe store's pool buffer) so a reclaimed block starts
// empty instead of inheriting a dead probe's answer.
//
// ══ Lmax IS STILL AN OPEN DECISION, AND THIS FILE MEASURES IT ═══════════════
//
// `Lmax` implies a per-ray CLAMP, and a clamp loses energy at exactly the bright
// hits that matter most. §12.13.4 left the choice (hard clamp vs per-frame
// auto-exposure) deliberately open, to be decided from a measured hit-radiance
// distribution rather than in advance. So the clamp COUNTS itself: `stats`
// carries clamped-deposit and max-observed-radiance counters, which is the
// instrument that decision needs. A clamp that never fires is the evidence for
// keeping it.
//
// ══ WHAT SHADES A HIT — `srcShade.js`, AND STILL NOTHING BY DEFAULT ═════════
//
// `shadeHit` defaults to black, and with it black what survives the resolve is
// TRANSMITTANCE: a receiver lit by transmittance alone against the sky is
// ambient occlusion, which is §7's "AO-like short-range bounce" for Phase 2.
// That was never a placeholder standing in for the real thing — it is the real
// thing with one term zero, which is why it was checkable before this existed.
//
// Phase 5 fills it from `srcShade.js`'s `createSrcHitShader`, whose body is
// `srcRef.js`'s `makeHitShader` line for line. This file stays agnostic about
// what a hit is worth: it takes a `vec3` and a ray index, and everything about
// lights, surfaces, shadow rays and the bounce loop lives on the other side of
// that call. The one thing it does own is the SHADE TALLIES — see
// `createSrcShadeCounters`, which exists so the shader needs no binding of its
// own on the kernel closest to the eight-storage-buffer limit.

 * ══ §12.82 THE SUN SPLIT — WHY FOUR MORE WORDS ═════════════════════════════
 *
 * `BIN_R/G/B` store ACCUMULATED RADIANCE, and radiance is a function of the sun
 * angle. The user's Level runs a day cycle (`Rotator.ts`, an
 * `@executeInEditMode` script that assigns `rotation = f(engine.time.elapsed)`
 * — ~0.1 rad/s, a 62.8 s cycle), so every stored value is stale by an amount
 * proportional to how long ago its bin was last refreshed. Walk into a room and
 * neighbouring bins are stale by DIFFERENT amounts; **that disagreement is the
 * bright/dark patchwork the user reports**, measured at `checker` 0.0415 on
 * arrival against 0.0046 with the sun pinned — 9×, with no decay at all in the
 * pinned arm.
 *
 * ⛔ IT IS NOT A BLEND RATE. α ×5 leaves the picture **77% blockier at rest and
 * slower to settle** (0.0044 → 0.0078, 2084 → 2660 ms); the probe ray cap ×4
 * does nothing measurable. No rate fixes a stored quantity whose TARGET moves
 * every frame — and the §12.43 tracking window makes it worse by design, because
 * a continuously-moving sun keeps it armed and it keeps throwing history away.
 *
 * So the sun stops being STORED and starts being EVALUATED. What is cached is
 * the part of a hit that a rotating sun does not change:
 *
 *   `BIN_SR/SG/SB`  Σ w · (ρ/π) · V_sun   the sun's TRANSFER — albedo and
 *                   shadow, no cosine, no irradiance. Accumulated and decayed
 *                   exactly like radiance, so it inherits the evidence
 *                   weighting and the noise averaging that make `ΣR/Σcount` an
 *                   exponentially-weighted mean over RAYS.
 *   `BIN_SN`        the hit NORMAL, octahedral-packed into 15:15 + a flag, LAST WRITE
 *                   WINS. A normal is geometry, not a measurement: it needs a
 *                   representative value, not an average, and one word instead
 *                   of three is what keeps this affordable (see the budget
 *                   note below).
 *
 * and `[F]` closes it every frame against the CURRENT sun:
 *
 *     L = ΣR·Lmax/Σcount  +  (ΣS/Σcount) · E_sun(now) · max(0, n̂ · l(now))
 *
 * A rotating sun then invalidates NOTHING. Only genuine multi-bounce residue
 * accumulates slowly, which is the thing temporal accumulation is actually for.
 *
 * ⚠ **WHAT STAYS STALE, NAMED SO IT IS NOT MISREAD AS FIXED: V.** Visibility
 * toward the sun is not sun-independent and cannot be made analytic without
 * re-tracing a shadow ray per bin per frame, which is the cost this whole
 * module is built to avoid. So the fully-lit and fully-shadowed regions stop
 * drifting and the SHADOW BOUNDARIES still lag at the old refresh rate. That is
 * the honest maximum here, and it is the right trade: a late shadow edge reads
 * as a soft penumbra, a stale cosine reads as the blocky patchwork.
 *
 * ⚠ **AND WHY NOT SIX WORDS.** The obvious form accumulates `Σ w·V·n` as three
 * signed words instead of packing one. It does not fit: at the grown pool
 * (`BIN_BUDGET` 2.8 M, the Bistro sizing) eleven words is 123 MB of `scratch`
 * BEFORE [J]'s hit list and the per-block statistics, which ride the same
 * buffer, and the 128 MiB binding limit is what killed capacity-addressed bins
 * in the first place (§12.16). Nine words leaves ~17 MB of headroom there. The
 * constructor throws with the arithmetic if a future pool eats it.

 * `writePayload` / `writePayloadUnknown` below are the only four ways in, and
 * `decodePayload` / `encodePayload` are their CPU twins for the mirror gates
 * and the probes (`srcMath.js` owns the binary16 conversion). A fifth path
 * would be a second definition of the layout.
 *
 * `PAYLOAD_CHANNELS` is the DECODED stride — what `decodePayload` hands back

 * · `SHADOWRAYS` — the cost of the whole phase, in the only unit that matters.
 * · `EMISSIVE` — hits that delivered their own emission, the ray-hit half of R5's
 *   handoff.
 * · `EMIT_ZEROED` — **ZERO IS THE HEALTHY READING, and that is not the sense
 *   §12.26 wrote it in.** R5's zeroing already happens on the CPU, at bake time:
 *   `GISystem#slotSurface` and `dynamicObjects`' `writeSurface` both publish a
 *   promoted emitter's emissive as 0, and that guard is itself a paid-for fix —
 *   `writeSurface` once published the raw emissive unconditionally, and an
 *   emissive mesh that was both promoted AND traced delivered its light twice.
 *   The promotion set IS the NEE set, so the bake zeroes exactly what the
 *   sampler will deliver, and the hit has nothing left to withhold.
 *
 *   The shader keeps its zeroing branch anyway, and this counter is what makes
 *   that branch worth having: it counts hits that landed on a NEE-flagged
 *   emitter and STILL carried emission — i.e. surfaces the bake missed. A
 *   nonzero reading is a bug in the promotion bookkeeping, caught before it
 *   reaches the image as light delivered twice.
 *
 *   **Do not "fix" a zero here by shipping unzeroed emissive to the palette.**
 *   That moves R5 to a third implementation and makes the flag and the
 *   promotion set two sources of truth for one fact, which is the crossed-
 *   numbering shape §12.9 warns any successor about. The handoff's real gate is
 *   an ENERGY arm (§12.26.7: analytic-on vs analytic-off, mean over a region,
 *   2.60×), which measures the same property under either design.
 * · `ALBEDO_CLAMPED` — R4's ceiling, counting itself, exactly as `STAT_CLAMPED`
 *   does for Lmax. A ceiling that never binds is the evidence for keeping it.
 * · `IMPORTANCE_FLOORED` — the instrument that says a light ranking is broken.
 *   The floor keeps the energy and bounds the firefly; it does NOT make a bad
 *   ranking usable, and this counter is the difference between knowing that and
 *   shipping 37× the standard error.

 * @param {Node} [options.influxLift]  uniform in [0,1] — how much of the per
 *   block α compensation is LIFTED (§12.40.4). At 0 the decay slows on capped
 *   blocks to hold `influx/(1−keep′)` at its uncapped value (variance-neutral
 *   still scene); at 1 the compensation is fully suspended and the decay is
 *   bit-identical to the uncompensated build. srcSystem drives it from the
 *   motion-adaptive α's own motion term, which is what retires stale bins:
 *   full compensation makes `keep′` close enough to 1 that the integer
 *   decay's rounding fixed point (0.5/(1−keep′)) can park a no-longer
 *   sampled bin ABOVE `MIN_WEIGHT` — a forever-readable stale bin, R1's dark
 *   vote — but a still scene is precisely the case where a stale value is
 *   still the true one, and any change the motion signal can see raises the
 *   lift, restores the fast decay, and retires the bin normally. The one gap
 *   is a change the signal misses (its floor is §12.38.3's blind-spot list),
 *   which is a property of the signal, not of this pass. Omitted, the branch
 *   is not built and the decay is byte-identical to the pre-compensation
 *   kernel — where every gate written before it runs.
 * @param {object} [options.surprise]  the per-block surprise bundle
 *   (`srcConfig.js`'s SURPRISE block). Two effects, both optional together:
 *   [E] sums each deposit's luma and weight into the block's `BSTAT` record,
 *   and the DECAY reads the block's surprise word `u` and mixes `keep′` toward
 *   `surpriseF`. Omitted, NOT ONE NODE OF EITHER IS BUILT and both kernels are

 *   above already runs under, and what keeps every gate written before this
 *   comparable rather than merely passing.
 *   `{ statBase, surpriseF }`, where `statBase` must be the store's

    // expensive GI dispatch in the frame at 13.3 ms isolated.

    //     `DEPOSIT_SCALE` — so each is <= `count` on arrival;
    //   · the decay `floor(x·k + 0.5)` is MONOTONIC in x, so `x <= count` is
    //     preserved through any number of frames of decay.
    // Therefore count 0 ⇒ all seven are 0, and `floor(0·k + 0.5) = 0` — the
    // stores this loop would emit write 0 over 0. Nothing downstream can see
    // the difference; the resolve retires the bin on `count < MIN_WEIGHT`
    // regardless of what the radiance words hold.
    //
    // ⚠ `k <= 0` MUST STILL RUN THE LOOP, AND THAT IS NOT A DETAIL. `BIN_SN`
    // is never decayed, so a long-dead block can hold a stale normal after its
    // count has faded to zero — and the ONE event that must clear it is the
    // reclaim, which arrives as `k = 0` from the claim-stamp check above. Skip
    // that frame and a new probe inherits a dead one's direction, which is
    // exactly the §12.82 defect whose comment below records it costing "a

  // Dispatched over TRANSPORT THREADS, not pixels — see `transportPixel` in
  // srcMathTsl. This pass is 22.3 ms of a 34 ms SRC chain on the user's editor
  // and roughly 6 ms of that was launching threads that immediately returned,
  // which is what a pixel-sized dispatch under a ray ceiling costs (§12.32).
  //
  // WITH A WORKLIST (`rayWork`, §12.44) the thread → pixel map is [D5]'s own
  // winner list, dense: thread i traces worklist pixel i and the trailing
  // threads return in WHOLE warps. This is what converts the per-probe cap's
  // ray cut into wall-clock — with the classic mapping the ~19% winners were
  // SCATTERED, so nearly every 32-wide warp still contained a tracer and the
  // pass ran at full width (19 ms for 25k rays, the user's editor). The
  // mapping-agreement hazard below also DISSOLVES on this path: the list is
  // written by [D5] in the same frame, so [E] cannot enumerate a pixel [D5]
  // did not own.
  //
  // ⚠ ON THE CLASSIC PATH (no worklist — gates built before it) THE MAPPING
  // MUST MATCH srcRays' [D1]/[D5] EXACTLY — same helper, same `stride`/
  // `phase` uniforms, same frame. [D5] writes `pixelRayBase` only for the
  // pixels it owns, so a mismatch here reads an entry from an OLDER frame: a

    // it unrolled at graph-build time and emitted the WHOLE body once per ray:
    // the trace, the hit shading, the NEE set, the analytic emitter shapes and
    // the cascade scatter. At the shipping `raysPerPixel = 2` that is two
    // complete copies, and this kernel is 83.5% of a GI boot (§13.16: 49.1 s
    // of a 58.8 s TTFF, 13.6 s isolated). The dumped WGSL showed it plainly —
    // `giEmitterFactor` appeared 8× in `main`, in two byte-identical clusters
    // 1,700 lines apart differing only in which hit point they read.
    //
    // Rolling it changes NOTHING about the estimator: iterations are
    // independent, each ray still gets its own R2 index, its own trace and its
    // own scatter, in the same order. That is what makes this the cheapest
    // startup win available here — unlike the emitter-slot roll (§13.16 fix A),
    // which has to preserve an importance CDF, and unlike gating the slots on
    // scene content (§12.47.1), which re-introduces a mid-game rebuild.

    // ⚠ `k` was used in exactly ONE place (`base.add(uint(k))`) — audited
    // before the change, because a JS-indexed array inside the body would not
    // survive becoming a GPU index. The cascade scatter below still unrolls on

  // ══ AND UNDER DECAY THE TEST IS A WEIGHT FLOOR, NOT A ZERO TEST ════════════

  // so the bin keeps FULL confidence in an ever-staler answer. That alone would
  // be defensible (it is the best information there is, and R1 prefers it to an
  // absence). What is not defensible is where it ends up.

  // **THE RADIANCE HITS ZERO BEFORE THE COUNT DOES.** `R` is `L/Lmax` of
  // `count`, so for any bin dimmer than the ceiling `R` is the smaller number
  // and truncation retires it first. The last few frames of a bin's life
  // therefore read `R = 0, count = small` — full-confidence BLACK, which is
  // precisely the dark vote R1 forbids, arriving by arithmetic rather than by
  // anyone deciding it. `MIN_WEIGHT` retires the bin while `R` still has bits:
  // a sixty-fourth of one ray, which is ~40 frames of not being sampled at
  // α = 0.1, and quantizes `L` no coarser than `Lmax/1024`.
