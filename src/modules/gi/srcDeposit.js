// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — [E] the split scatter, [F] the resolve.
//
// One ray, traced once, deposited into EVERY cascade of its pixel's ancestor
// chain. That is the "split" in Split Radiance Cascades and it is why no cascade
// ever traces its own rays: the cascades below the hit each learn "this
// direction was clear through my interval", the cascade OWNING the hit learns
// what was there, and nothing above it learns anything at all.
//
// `srcMath.js`'s `splitDeposits` is the mirror and its header carries the rule
// this file must not get wrong:
//
//   d in cascade k  →  cascades 0..k-1 get (L = 0, T = 1)
//                      cascade  k       gets (L = hit radiance, T = 0)
//                      cascades k+1..   get NOTHING
//   a miss          →  every cascade gets (L = 0, T = 1)
//
// **Nothing is deposited above the owning cascade.** The companion guide has
// this wrong; the authors rejected upward extension for bias. And the sky is not
// deposited here either — it composites once at the top of the merge, because a
// per-cascade sky deposit multiplies it by the cascade count.
//
// ══ WHY THE ACCUMULATORS ARE FIXED POINT, AND WHAT F=16 BOUGHT ══════════════
//
// WGSL has no float atomics, so radiance accumulates as `round(L/Lmax · 2^F)`.
// §12.13.4 measured the headroom: bins average **0.78 rays/bin at every
// cascade** (the probes÷4 and bins×4 per level cancel), and F=16 overflows only
// at 65,536 saturated rays in ONE bin — about 84,000× the measured average.
//
// TRANSMITTANCE AND COUNT ARE FIXED POINT TOO — but only since the temporal
// blend, and for a reason that has nothing to do with precision. Every deposit's
// T is exactly 0 or 1, so before Phase 4 `sumT` was an integer count of clear
// deposits and `T = sumT/count` was exact with no scale at all. Then the decay
// arrived, and `floor(1 · 0.9) = 0`: a count of ONE — which at 0.78 rays/bin is
// the common case, not the corner — would drop to zero on the very next frame
// and the bin would go back to UNKNOWN having just been sampled. So both words
// carry `DEPOSIT_F` fractional bits, the same as radiance, and they are no
// longer counts but WEIGHTS. The scale then cancels out of `L = ΣR/Σcount`
// exactly (`toL` is `Lmax/count`, with no `2^F` in it at all), so the resolve
// got simpler rather than more complicated.
//
// ══ THE TEMPORAL BLEND LIVES HERE, NOT ON THE RESOLVED PAYLOAD ══════════════
//
// Plan §4.1 [F] put it on the payload — "temporal blend with resident probe
// history" — and §4.2 sized `binPayload` to match, as "the resolved payload plus
// the pre-averaged cone mirror written by the merge". [G] then merged IN PLACE
// (§12.20.1, worth 22 MB), which means the resolved payload does not survive its
// own frame: by the time the next frame could blend against it, the merge has
// overwritten it with `own + T · parent`.
//
// **Blending the merged payload in place is not merely inelegant, it multiplies
// the parent's light by 1/α.** With `H ← (1−α)H + αS` and then `H ← H + T·P`,
// the fixed point is `H = L + T·P/α` — at α = 0.1 the whole cascade above a
// probe arrives ten times over. The alternative that keeps the plan's placement
// is a second payload buffer, giving back exactly the 22 MB [G] saved.
//
// So the blend moves one stage EARLIER, onto the accumulators, where it is
// better on three counts and worse on none:
//
//   1. **It weights by EVIDENCE.** A payload EMA gives one frame's single ray
//      the same weight as another frame's twenty. Decaying the sums and the
//      count together makes `ΣR/Σcount` an exponentially-weighted mean over
//      RAYS. At §12.13.4's measured 0.78 rays/bin this is the difference
//      between an average and a lottery.
//   2. **It needs no warmup path.** See `TEMPORAL_ALPHA` in srcConfig — a fresh
//      block's sums are zero, so its first frame resolves to that frame's own
//      rays, at full weight, with nothing to crawl up from. R6 for free.
//   3. **α = 1 is the code, not a branch.** `keep = 0` zeroes every word, which
//      is precisely the clear pass this replaced. Single-frame mode — §4.6's
//      quality-gate configuration — is one uniform, and every single-frame gate
//      in the suite is unaffected whatever α is set to, because frame one has no
//      history either way.
//
// It costs a read where the clear only wrote, and one word per bin block (the
// claim stamp, in the probe store's pool buffer) so a reclaimed block starts
// empty instead of inheriting a dead probe's answer.
//
// ══ Lmax IS STILL AN OPEN DECISION, AND THIS FILE MEASURES IT ═══════════════
//
// `Lmax` implies a per-ray CLAMP, and a clamp loses energy at exactly the bright
// hits that matter most. §12.13.4 left the choice (hard clamp vs per-frame
// auto-exposure) deliberately open, to be decided from a measured hit-radiance
// distribution rather than in advance. So the clamp COUNTS itself: `stats`
// carries clamped-deposit and max-observed-radiance counters, which is the
// instrument that decision needs. A clamp that never fires is the evidence for
// keeping it.
//
// ══ WHAT SHADES A HIT — `srcShade.js`, AND STILL NOTHING BY DEFAULT ═════════
//
// `shadeHit` defaults to black, and with it black what survives the resolve is
// TRANSMITTANCE: a receiver lit by transmittance alone against the sky is
// ambient occlusion, which is §7's "AO-like short-range bounce" for Phase 2.
// That was never a placeholder standing in for the real thing — it is the real
// thing with one term zero, which is why it was checkable before this existed.
//
// Phase 5 fills it from `srcShade.js` (`createSrcHitAttribution` in [E],
// `createSrcHitLighting` in [J] — together `srcRef.js`'s `makeHitShader` line
// for line). This file stays agnostic about
// what a hit is worth: it takes a `vec3` and a ray index, and everything about
// lights, surfaces, shadow rays and the bounce loop lives on the other side of
// that call. The one thing it does own is the SHADE TALLIES — see
// `createSrcShadeCounters`, which exists so the shader needs no binding of its
// own on the kernel closest to the eight-storage-buffer limit.

 * ══ [J]'s HIT LIST — A REGION OF `scratch`, NOT A BUFFER OF ITS OWN ═════════
 *
 * The multibounce pass re-shades last frame's hits against the tile atlas, so

 * per-frame list, and a list is a buffer — except that [E] is at 7 of the 8
 * storage bindings a portable stage gets, and [J] itself must read the bins to

 * `hitListBase` is the atomic count, entries follow it, and BOTH passes see one
 * buffer where a separate list would have cost [E] its last binding (R7 —
 * `hashKeys` carries the hash→block words for the same reason).
 *
 * Entries are UNPACKED floats through `floatBitsToUint`, not a quantized
 * encoding: `dynamicObjects.js`'s triangle pool sets the precedent, and the
 * one thing [J] must not do is re-derive a hit's position approximately —
 * a gather at the wrong point reads a plausible irradiance from the wrong side
 * of a wall, which no energy check downstream can see.
 *
 * ══ SINCE §12.53 THIS RECORD IS THE WHOLE [E] → [J] INTERFACE ══════════════
 *
 * It used to carry the three things the SECOND BOUNCE could not recompute.
 * Now it carries everything ANY shading needs, because `shadeHit` itself moved:
 * [E] traces and attributes, [J] shades, gathers and deposits. The four words

 *
 * ══ SINCE §12.53 THEY ARE WRITTEN BY TWO KERNELS, NOT ONE ══════════════════
 *
 * The shading split put the surface half in [E] and the light half in [J], and
 * these words follow their own half. One `stats` buffer, two writers, no new
 * binding on either side (both kernels already bind it):
 *
 *   [E]  SHADED · UNATTRIBUTED · ALBEDO_CLAMPED   — properties of a SURFACE,
 *        counted for every ray the deposit attributes, hit or miss, exactly as
 *        before, so `unattributedRate` keeps its historical denominator.
 *   [J]  SHADOWRAYS · EMISSIVE · EMIT_ZEROED · IMPORTANCE_FLOORED · CLAMPED ·
 *        MAXL — properties of the LIGHTING, counted for hits that reached a
 *        destination bin. ⚠ These three DENOMINATORS SHRANK at the split: the
 *        un-split kernel shaded every ray including the ~76% that miss (their
 *        radiance was computed and then discarded by `own == N`), so it counted
 *        shadow rays and emissive hits for garbage attributions of empty space.
 *        The estimator never used them; the counters did.
 *
 * The list itself:
 *
 * · `SHADED` / `UNATTRIBUTED` — R1. A hit whose surface could not be identified
 *   shades at the default albedo with no emission, which is a plausible-looking
 *   grey. The ratio is the only thing that says how much of the frame that is.
 * · `SHADOWRAYS` — the cost of the whole phase, in the only unit that matters.
 * · `EMISSIVE` — hits that delivered their own emission, the ray-hit half of R5's
 *   handoff.
 * · `EMIT_ZEROED` — **ZERO IS THE HEALTHY READING, and that is not the sense
 *   §12.26 wrote it in.** R5's zeroing already happens on the CPU, at bake time:
 *   `GISystem#slotSurface` and `dynamicObjects`' `writeSurface` both publish a
 *   promoted emitter's emissive as 0, and that guard is itself a paid-for fix —
 *   `writeSurface` once published the raw emissive unconditionally, and an
 *   emissive mesh that was both promoted AND traced delivered its light twice.
 *   The promotion set IS the NEE set, so the bake zeroes exactly what the
 *   sampler will deliver, and the hit has nothing left to withhold.
 *
 *   The shader keeps its zeroing branch anyway, and this counter is what makes
 *   that branch worth having: it counts hits that landed on a NEE-flagged
 *   emitter and STILL carried emission — i.e. surfaces the bake missed. A
 *   nonzero reading is a bug in the promotion bookkeeping, caught before it
 *   reaches the image as light delivered twice.
 *
 *   **Do not "fix" a zero here by shipping unzeroed emissive to the palette.**
 *   That moves R5 to a third implementation and makes the flag and the
 *   promotion set two sources of truth for one fact, which is the crossed-
 *   numbering shape §12.9 warns any successor about. The handoff's real gate is
 *   an ENERGY arm (§12.26.7: analytic-on vs analytic-off, mean over a region,
 *   2.60×), which measures the same property under either design.
 * · `ALBEDO_CLAMPED` — R4's ceiling, counting itself, exactly as `STAT_CLAMPED`
 *   does for Lmax. A ceiling that never binds is the evidence for keeping it.
 * · `IMPORTANCE_FLOORED` — the instrument that says a light ranking is broken.
 *   The floor keeps the energy and bounds the firefly; it does NOT make a bad
 *   ranking usable, and this counter is the difference between knowing that and
 *   shipping 37× the standard error.

 *   produce entries (`transportThreads × raysPerPixel`) and bounce light is
 *   being dropped where nothing on screen would say so.
 * · `SECONDARY` and `SEC_CLAMPED` are written by [J]. `SECONDARY` is the

 * @param {object} options
 * @param {object} options.pixelProbe    per-pixel c0 probe index
 * @param {object} options.pixelRayBase  Alg. 3's per-pixel ray base
 * @param {(o, d, tMax) => object} options.trace  from `createSrcSceneTrace`
 * @param {(hit, dir, rayIndex) => object} [options.shadeHit]  vec3 radiance
 *   at a hit — the pre-[J] one-kernel form, unused by the default arm (always
 *   null; shading happens via `attribute` here and `createSrcHitLighting` in
 *   [J]). Default black — see the
 *   header. `rayIndex` is `n`, the ray's place in the global R2 sequence, and
 *   the shader needs it for the same reason the gate's synthetic trace does: a
 *   pure function of a u32 is bit-identical across a boundary where an RNG state
 *   is not.
 *
 *   THE ONE-KERNEL FORM. Mutually exclusive with `attribute` below, and the
 *   constructor refuses both: a kernel that shades inline AND appends would
 *   have [J] shade the same hit a second time and deposit it twice.
 * @param {(hit, dir) => {P, n, rho, emissive, emitter}} [options.attribute]
 *   THE SPLIT FORM (§12.53), from `srcShade.js`'s `createSrcHitAttribution`.
 *   With it, this kernel does NOT shade: it traces, attributes, and appends the
 *   record `srcSecondary.js` shades from. The radiance words of the owning bin
 *   are left for [J]; every other deposit (transmittance below the hit, the
 *   count on the whole chain, a miss's all-clear) is made here, unchanged.
 *   Requires `secondary` — there is nowhere to put an entry without it.
 * @param {{base: number, capacity: number}} [options.secondary]  [J]'s hit list
 *   in `scratch`'s tail (`createSrcBinStore`'s `hitListBase`/`hitCapacity`).
 *   Supplied, this kernel appends one entry per attributed hit that has
 *   somewhere to deposit; omitted, NOT ONE NODE OF THAT IS BUILT and the emitted
 *   WGSL is byte-identical to the pre-[J] kernel — which is what keeps every
 *   gate written before the multibounce (and `scripts/gi-src-deposit.html`,
 *   whose synthetic shader shades inline) comparable rather than merely
 *   passing.
 * @param {object} options.lmax  uniform: the radiance the fixed point saturates at
 * @param {Node} [options.keep]  the temporal blend's `1 − α`, applied to every
 *   accumulator before this frame's deposits land. Default 0, which is the
 *   single-frame behaviour every gate written before Phase 4 assumes.
 * @param {Node} [options.frameStamp]  the frame number `createSrcProbeFrame`
 *   stamps onto freshly claimed blocks. Must be the same node.
 * @param {object} [options.rayWork]  the ray store's winner worklist — word 0
 *   the count, entries after it, ONE buffer (its store doc carries the
 *   binding-budget measurement behind that). [E] traces densely from it
 *   instead of striding the pixel set (§12.44); omitted, [E] keeps the
 *   classic thread → pixel mapping every pre-compaction gate runs.
 * @param {Node} [options.influxLift]  uniform in [0,1] — how much of the per
 *   block α compensation is LIFTED (§12.40.4). At 0 the decay slows on capped
 *   blocks to hold `influx/(1−keep′)` at its uncapped value (variance-neutral
 *   still scene); at 1 the compensation is fully suspended and the decay is
 *   bit-identical to the uncompensated build. srcSystem drives it from the
 *   motion-adaptive α's own motion term, which is what retires stale bins:
 *   full compensation makes `keep′` close enough to 1 that the integer
 *   decay's rounding fixed point (0.5/(1−keep′)) can park a no-longer
 *   sampled bin ABOVE `MIN_WEIGHT` — a forever-readable stale bin, R1's dark
 *   vote — but a still scene is precisely the case where a stale value is
 *   still the true one, and any change the motion signal can see raises the
 *   lift, restores the fast decay, and retires the bin normally. The one gap
 *   is a change the signal misses (its floor is §12.38.3's blind-spot list),
 *   which is a property of the signal, not of this pass. Omitted, the branch
 *   is not built and the decay is byte-identical to the pre-compensation
 *   kernel — where every gate written before it runs.
 * @param {object} [options.surprise]  the per-block surprise bundle
 *   (`srcConfig.js`'s SURPRISE block). Two effects, both optional together:
 *   [E] sums each deposit's luma and weight into the block's `BSTAT` record,
 *   and the DECAY reads the block's surprise word `u` and mixes `keep′` toward
 *   `surpriseF`. Omitted, NOT ONE NODE OF EITHER IS BUILT and both kernels are
 *   byte-identical to the pre-surprise build — the discipline `secondary`
 *   above already runs under, and what keeps every gate written before this
 *   comparable rather than merely passing.
 *   `{ statBase, surpriseF }`, where `statBase` must be the store's
 *   `blockStatBase` and `surpriseF` is a uniform ≥ 1 (`1` = no acceleration,
 *   which srcSystem uses when α is pinned).

  //
  // WITH A WORKLIST (`rayWork`, §12.44) the thread → pixel map is [D5]'s own
  // winner list, dense: thread i traces worklist pixel i and the trailing
  // threads return in WHOLE warps. This is what converts the per-probe cap's

  // SCATTERED, so nearly every 32-wide warp still contained a tracer and the
  // pass ran at full width (19 ms for 25k rays, the user's editor). The
  // mapping-agreement hazard below also DISSOLVES on this path: the list is
  // written by [D5] in the same frame, so [E] cannot enumerate a pixel [D5]
  // did not own.

    // the trace, the hit shading, the NEE set, the analytic emitter shapes and
    // the cascade scatter. At the shipping `raysPerPixel = 2` that is two
    // complete copies, and this kernel is 83.5% of a GI boot (§13.16: 49.1 s
    // of a 58.8 s TTFF, 13.6 s isolated). The dumped WGSL showed it plainly —
    // `giEmitterFactor` appeared 8× in `main`, in two byte-identical clusters
    // 1,700 lines apart differing only in which hit point they read.
    //
    // Rolling it changes NOTHING about the estimator: iterations are
    // independent, each ray still gets its own R2 index, its own trace and its
    // own scatter, in the same order. That is what makes this the cheapest
    // startup win available here — unlike the emitter-slot roll (§13.16 fix A),
    // which has to preserve an importance CDF, and unlike gating the slots on
    // scene content (§12.47.1), which re-introduces a mid-game rebuild.

  // ── [F] resolve ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  // ZERO-COUNT BINS ARE UNKNOWN, NOT ZERO — `srcMath.js`'s `resolveBin` returns
  // null and this writes T = -1, which is outside transmittance's [0,1] range
  // and so cannot be mistaken for data. Feeding an unsampled bin in as black is
  // a hard cliff at the edge of every sparsely-sampled region, and the sparsity
  // table in §12.13.4 (0.78 rays per bin on average) is why that edge is
  // everywhere rather than exotic.
  //
  // ══ AND UNDER DECAY THE TEST IS A WEIGHT FLOOR, NOT A ZERO TEST ════════════
  //
  // A bin that stops being sampled does not stop reporting: its weight fades
  // geometrically and `L = ΣR/Σcount` renormalizes by that same fading weight,
  // so the bin keeps FULL confidence in an ever-staler answer. That alone would
  // be defensible (it is the best information there is, and R1 prefers it to an
  // absence). What is not defensible is where it ends up.
  //
  // **THE RADIANCE HITS ZERO BEFORE THE COUNT DOES.** `R` is `L/Lmax` of
  // `count`, so for any bin dimmer than the ceiling `R` is the smaller number
  // and truncation retires it first. The last few frames of a bin's life
  // therefore read `R = 0, count = small` — full-confidence BLACK, which is
  // precisely the dark vote R1 forbids, arriving by arithmetic rather than by
  // anyone deciding it. `MIN_WEIGHT` retires the bin while `R` still has bits:
  // a sixty-fourth of one ray, which is ~40 frames of not being sampled at
  // α = 0.1, and quantizes `L` no coarser than `Lmax/1024`.
  //
  // At α = 1 every count is a whole number of rays, so the floor never binds and
  // this is the zero test it always was.
