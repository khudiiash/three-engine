// `makeHitShader`, line for line.
//
//     L_hit = emissive(H) + ρ(H)/π · [ Σ_lights direct(H) + E_secondary(H) ]
//
// Plan §4.4, and the executable spec is §12.26 — a CPU mirror whose 124 checks
// ran the whole of this before a line of it existed on the GPU. Every constant,
// every ordering and every early-out below is that mirror's, and where this file
// says a thing is measured, the measurement is §12.26's and not a guess.
//
// ══ THE THINGS THAT ARE ABSENT, AND WHY EACH ABSENCE IS STRUCTURAL ══════════
//
// **MOVERS ARE NOT A BRANCH.** §4.4 asks for "header mean albedo/emissive
// Lambert shading" for an exact dynamic hit, which is the same expression with
// the surface read from somewhere else — so provenance lives entirely in
// `surfaceAt` and this file never asks whether a hit moved. A mover-shaped `if`
// here is the shape of the bug where a moving crate lights the room differently
// from the identical static one beside it, and that bug is invisible until
// somebody picks the crate up.
//
// **THE SKY IS NOT HERE.** A ray that escapes composites the sky in
// `mergeCascades`, at the top cascade, exactly once. Adding it at the hit would
// double it for every ray that both misses and merges.
//
// **NO LOOP OVER LIGHTS WITH A BREAK.** The emitter pick is a running-sum
// select over an unrolled `MAX_EMITTERS`, the same divergence-free form
// `splitCascade` uses in the deposit. The one expensive thing — the shadow ray —
// is issued ONCE, after the pick, which is the entire point of NEE.
//
// ══ THE FACE-FORWARD FLIP IS HERE, AND THAT CONTRADICTS §12.17 ON PURPOSE ═══
//
// §12.17 concluded that the face-forward flip belongs at the engine boundary
// (`readPixel`) and never in a kernel, because a flip on one side of the
// CPU/GPU boundary made each side fill the half of the bin sphere the other
// never read. **The hit normal is not that normal.** It is produced by the trace
// inside this same kernel, one line earlier, and a record normal is sign-aligned
// to the occupancy gradient — it knows nothing about which side a particular ray
// approached from. Unflipped, every hit on the FAR face of a wall returns
// cos < 0 for every light and shades black: half the geometry in a closed room,
// dark. §12.26.4 gates it two ways — the flip only ever changes the SIGN, and a
// scene whose record normals are all reported the other way round shades
// bit-identically.
//
// ══ WHAT IS STILL STUBBED, NAMED SO IT CANNOT BE MISREAD AS FINISHED ════════
//
// · `surfaceAt` for STATIC hits does not exist yet. §12.9 deleted the coarse
//   surface-attribution grid (`cellAttr`/`slotAtlas`), and `SURFACE_MATERIAL_ID_WORD`
//   was long since repurposed as the complex-cell triangle range, so there is no
//   path on the GPU from a static hit to its material. Until `srcSurface.js`
//   lands, statics shade at `defaultAlbedo` with zero emission — a grey-box
//   bounce, correct in shape and wrong in colour, and `STAT_UNATTRIBUTED` counts
//   every hit it happened to. Movers already have theirs
//   (`moverSurfaceAt` → header words 34..39).
// · THE SECONDARY TERM IS NOT EVALUATED HERE AND MUST NOT BE. The formula above
//   is still the model — `E` gains the cache's irradiance and ρ/π multiplies
//   the sum — but the `E_secondary` half is computed by `srcSecondary.js` in a
//   PASS OF ITS OWN and added into the same bin. Inlining it cost 48 seconds of
//   pipeline compile (§12.39): `gatherAt` is 16 hash-find loops and 16 filtered
//   taps, and this shader used to be instantiated inside the deposit's ray loop,
//   which was the fattest kernel in the module.
//
// ══ THE FILE IS TWO HALVES NOW, AND THEY COMPILE IN DIFFERENT KERNELS ═══════
//
// §12.53. Hit shading is a COMPOSITION of two factories that the engine builds
// separately:
//
//   · `createSrcHitAttribution` — surfaceAt, the face-forward flip, R4's albedo
//     ceiling. Cheap, and it needs the trace's hit record, so it stays in [E].
//   · `createSrcHitLighting` — the visibility marcher, the four rolled light
//     slots, the NEE emitter set and the analytic shapes. Expensive to COMPILE
//     (the marcher is ~1.2 s of shader compile per call site and this half has
//     two of them), and it needs nothing from the trace but P, n̂, ρ, Le and the
//     ray index — five values that fit in a hit-list entry. So it moves to [J].
//
// That is the whole of §12.49's named follow-on: the deposit was 179 kB and one
// pipeline of it measured 49-56 s of a cold boot, and §13.17 says two ~75 kB
// kernels compiling in parallel beat one monster by MORE than the byte ratio.
// The estimator is untouched — the same nodes are emitted, in two kernels
// instead of one, and the ρ [J] multiplies by is still the one clamped here.
// · `importance` defaults to the exact contribution. `lightTree.js` is unwired;
//   when it lands it supplies a bounds-based ranking, and §12.26.5 prices what
//   that can cost at **3.00× the standard error** — 9× the samples for equal
//   noise. The parameter exists so that gets measured rather than asserted away.

/**
 * NEE over the emitter set: rank by importance, pick one, ONE shadow ray,
 * divide by the pick probability.
 *
 * ══ THE IMPORTANCE IS THE CONTRIBUTION, WHICH MAKES ONE SAMPLE EXACT ════════
 *
 * With `p_i ∝ luminance(E_i)`, `E_i/p_i` is the SUM for whichever i is drawn:
 * one sample is not an unbiased estimate of the total, it **is** the total, to
 * 2.28e-16, for every ray index. All remaining variance is visibility.
 *
 * ⚠ **AND IT IS EXACT IN LUMINANCE, NOT PER CHANNEL.** The pdf is one scalar and
 * the signal has three components, so a draw that is exact in the ranked
 * quantity redistributes the other two: a red emitter drawn in place of a blue
 * one of equal luminance returns the right amount of light in the wrong hue.
 * §12.26.5 measured the spread over 4,000 draws at **740% per channel against
 * 2.28e-16 in luminance**, with a grey-emitter control collapsing to 1.14e-16.
 * This will arrive on screen as coloured noise nobody predicted. It is a
 * property of every importance-sampled NEE, not a bug in the tree, and the fix
 * if it ever matters is to rank per channel or spend samples. **Compare
 * estimators in the quantity they estimate** — a per-channel standard error
 * reported 1.17× for a change actually worth 3.00×.
 *
 * ══ THE FLOOR IS A DIAGNOSIS, NOT A REPAIR ═════════════════════════════════
 *
 * R1 in its sampling costume: an emitter with a nonzero contribution and a zero
 * pick probability is energy that vanishes with nothing to attribute it to. The
 * mirror's first version floored the weight at a fixed `1e-12` — which trades a
 * lost light for a **firefly**, because the estimator divides by the pdf, and
 * "fireflies are impossible by construction here" is a property this module
 * relies on.
 *
 * So the floor is a FRACTION of the mean importance among CONTRIBUTORS —
 * scale-invariant, because a light tree's importance is in units of its own and
 * is not comparable to an irradiance — which bounds the worst single-sample
 * weight at `contributors / floorFraction` times the mean. It binds only when an
 * importance function is wrong, so the exact-pdf case is untouched and the
 * zero-variance property survives. Measured on a zero-ranked VISIBLE emitter
 * over 200,000 draws: energy survives (2.08% off, inside its own 3σ), worst
 * single-sample weight 3577× the mean against the 4096 analytic bound, standard
 * error **37×** the correct ranking's. The floor keeps the energy, bounds the
 * firefly, and hands back the variance; the COUNTER is what says a ranking is
 * broken.
 *
 * ══ THE DRAWS ARE STRATIFIED ═══════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * `u = (s + hash)/S`, one draw per stratum. 1 → 4 samples cuts the standard
 * error **2.61×** where independent draws would give 2.00×. Asserting only "the
 * mean is still right" would have passed on a loop that draws the same light S
 * times and divides by S.

/**
 * THE LIGHTING HALF — the sun, the punctual slots, the NEE emitter set, the
 * visibility marcher and R5's emission handoff. Runs in [J] since §12.53.
 *
 * Returns `light(P, n, rho, emissive, emitter, rayIndex) → vec3`, i.e.
 *
 *     Le' + ρ/π · Σ_lights direct(P, n̂)
 *
 * — the DIRECT half of §4.4's expression. The `E_secondary` half is added by
 * `srcSecondary.js` around this call, as `ρ/π · E_atlas`, so that the two terms
 * saturate against `Lmax` TOGETHER (one clamp, the inline form; §12.49's split
 * clamp is retired by the move, because both terms are now computed in one
 * kernel and there is nothing left to split).
 *
 * ⚠ **THIS IS THE EXPENSIVE HALF TO COMPILE, NOT TO RUN.** `visibility` is a
 * two-nested-loop BVH8 descent and it is instantiated at TWO call sites here
 * (the rolled light loop and NEE's single ray) — §13.14.5 measured ~1.2 s of
 * shader compile per call site. That is why it lives in a 64 kB kernel of its
 * own instead of inside the deposit's ray loop.
 *
 * @param {{direction: Node, irradiance: Node}} [options.sun]  a single
 *   directional source — `direction` points TOWARD it, `irradiance` is what a
 *   surface facing it square-on receives. This is `srcRef.js`'s `sunIrradiance`
 *   shape, kept so the CPU mirror stays the reference for this term.
 * @param {object[]} [options.lights]  `giLight.js` LIGHT slots (point and
 *   directional, `MAX_GI_LIGHTS` of them) — the engine path, one shadow ray per
 *   active slot. Independent of `sun`; the gate uses `sun`, the engine uses this.
 * @param {Node|number} [options.maxRay]  whole-medium ray bound, for a
 *   directional slot's shadow ray. Required when `lights` is non-empty.
 * @param {object[]} [options.emitters]  `giLight.js` emitter slots.
 * @param {(P, n, toLight, maxT) => Node} [options.visibility]  from
 *   `createSrcVisibility`. Its `maxT` is measured from the SURFACE point; the
 *   lift correction is that function's own (§12.26.3).
 * @param {Node} options.voxelSize  the DDA medium's quantization — every bias
 *   here tracks it (R2), and there is deliberately no default.
 * @param {object} [options.count]  per-statistic incrementers; see
 *   `srcDeposit.js`'s STAT words.
 * @returns {(P, n, rho, Le, emitter, rayIndex) => {L: Node}}
 *   `L` is the hit's radiance.

    // at a time — 4/3/2/1/0 inlinings gave 11814/11704/9739/8526/6938 ms — it is
