// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — the shape of the cascade hierarchy.
//
// docs/GI_SRC_REBUILD_PLAN.md §2 / §4. Pure JS, no three, no TSL: every
// consumer (CPU reference, GPU kernels, telemetry, tests) derives its numbers
// from HERE so there is exactly one definition of the hierarchy. A second
// place that computes an interval boundary is a leak waiting to be measured.
//
// ══ THE TWO SCALING FACTORS ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// β = 4  angular branching: |D_{i+1}| = 4·|D_i|, and the 4→1 parent mapping is
//        integer halving on the 2w×w bin grid (srcMath.binParent).
// γ = 4  interval scaling:  L_{i+1} = 4·L_i.
//
// BOTH, simultaneously — that is the paper's core theoretical claim (§3.2,
// Appendix A): the estimator minimizes `max(spatial error α, angular error ε)`
// only when ε scales WITH α. γ=2 lets angular error dominate the far cascades.
//
// This module previously ran BRANCH=2, and BRANCH=4 was rejected twice (see
// the plan's §11 decision log). Those rejections were measured on the DENSE
// LATTICE with the parallax merge kernel at c0DirRes 2–4 — a regime where
// angular resolution could not be raised to compensate. The merge here is
// count-weighted sparse with pre-averaging and no parallax re-aim, which is a
// different estimator; the falloff/chroma probes that produced the original
// rejections re-gate this one. If γ=4 fails them HERE that is a real finding
// to take upstream, not a config to quietly fudge.
//
// ══ SPACING vs INTERVAL — the one spatial dial ═══════════════════════════════
//
// `spacing0` (s₀) is THE live spatial dial (session-36 lesson: one dial, not
// a family of interacting ones). r₀ is DERIVED from it at a fixed ratio, so a
// user dragging spacing never desynchronizes the two.

 * pan probes (2026-08-14, `run-gi-sponza-*`) measured the half the rig never

 * the set of surface points feeding each probe is view-dependent, and a pan
 * shifts every probe's estimator equilibrium a little. At α 0.02 the whole
 * field then crawls to its new equilibrium over ~50 frames IN FULL VIEW:
 * post-pan holds measured 2.4 rev/px/s against a 0.155 parked floor (16×),
 * with the churn heatmap UNIFORM over lit content — not the pan's leading
 * edge — and every capacity/cold-start suspect acquitted by the stats dump
 * (hash load 1–2%, noBlock 0, ~30 fresh probes/frame, seed live). The §12.59.3

 * camera moves and through the hold, fading back to ALPHA_STILL after. 0.05

 *
 * Two coupled mechanisms, one switch (`__giSrcMotionTrack = false` restores
 * both old behaviours), and both arm on LIGHT EVENTS ONLY — light matrix
 * motion, luminance deltas, emitter changes — NEVER on mover displacement:
 *
 *  1. PEAK-HOLD (GISystem's `sceneMotion` closure): a light-side peak ≥
 *     ALPHA_TRACK_THRESHOLD arms a window of ALPHA_TRACK_HOLD_MS during
 *     which the closure reports the held peak — α (and §12.42's lift) stay
 *     at the change's level while the field actually converges instead of
 *     for the one frame the delta itself lasts.
 *  2. THE STRIDE ROOT RELAXES INSIDE THE WINDOW (srcSystem.syncCamera,
 *     via the `trackMotion` getter): `keep = (1−α)^(1/(1+(S−1)·(1−tr)))`,
 *     `tr` = the held light peak while the window is open, 0 otherwise. At

 * ⚠ WHY LIGHT-SIDE ONLY IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT A PREFERENCE. The first draft
 * armed on ANY motion peak and tied the root to α's own ramp position, and
 * TRACK_AB refuted it the day it was written: moving arms 21.5 vs 1.0

 * ⛔ §12.83 — A NOVELTY GATE WAS BUILT HERE AND BACKED OUT THE SAME HOUR. THE
 * PREMISE WAS A MISREAD LOG LINE, AND THE MISREADING IS THE THING WORTH
 * KEEPING (2026-08-23).
 *
 * The live receipt from the user's editor reads
 *
 *     [gi] light-track window: 1 arms in 2.0s (0.5/s), open 60% of 121 frames
 *          — armed by shadow 1, peak 0.53 (threshold 0.5)
 *
 * and "open 60% of frames" was read — here, in `gi-walk-transient`, and in the
 * plan's §12.82 banner ("open 43-58% of frames") — as a STEADY STATE: the
 * window open most of the time, flushing the screen irradiance filter and
 * lifting the ray cap for most of every second of play. That reading is wrong.
 * **The line is a ~2 s TALLY and it is printed ONLY when the window armed or
 * was open during that tally**, so "open 60%" is one 1200 ms hold inside one
 * 2 s span, and the spans in between print NOTHING. On the user's Level those
 * two lines are THREE MINUTES apart with silence between: two arms in ~210 s
 * = a **~1% duty cycle**, not 60%.
 *
 * §12.46's rising-edge arm is therefore doing its job. A simulation of the
 * exact arming block against their own day cycle (0.1 rad/s → a shadow term
 * of 0.52 at 72 fps, straddling the 0.5 threshold) with ±12% frame-rate
 * jitter: 1 arm and 2% open in 60 s. The straddle cannot re-arm because the
 * dips are ONE FRAME long and the dwell wants 800 ms of them.
 *
 * So: do not spend a unit on this window. Its cost is ~1% of frames, and the
 * §12.82 banner's "⭐ (3) is the next unit" rests on the same misreading and
 * is withdrawn. ⚠ The general trap: a periodic tally that suppresses its own
 * empty prints reads as a duty cycle and is a RATE — check the timestamps
 * between lines before believing a percentage.
 *
 * ── the original design, kept because the hole is real if narrow ───────────
 *
 * §12.46 (above) established the intent in as many words: *sustained motion
 * needs no window*. Its instrument was a RISING EDGE against a fixed absolute
 * threshold, and that instrument only works when the sustained signal sits
 * clearly above the threshold — then the edge never re-fires.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE SIGNAL STRADDLES THE THRESHOLD, and the user's own
 * Level does exactly that. A day cycle at 0.1 rad/s puts `shadowMotion /
 * ALPHA_MOTION_SAT` at ~0.62 at 60 fps and ~0.37 at 100 fps — so ordinary frame-
 * rate jitter walks the peak back and forth across 0.5, each dip clears the
 * 800 ms dwell, and the next rise arms a fresh 1200 ms window. The live receipt
 * from the user's editor, twice, minutes apart:
 *
 *     [gi] light-track window: 1 arms in 2.0s (0.5/s), open 60% of 121 frames
 *          — armed by shadow 1, peak 0.53 (threshold 0.5)
 *
 * i.e. the window is open **~60% of every second of play** for a sun that is
 * doing nothing eventful. What that costs, all three at once:
 *
 *   · `_giIrrHistWeightU = 0` (GISystem ~2262) — the §12.65 screen irradiance
 *     temporal filter is FLUSHED, so the raw gather goes to the screen and the
 *     c0 probe lattice's own per-probe variance is the picture. At s₀ = 0.45 m
 *     that is a ~0.45 m tent on every surface — the user's "blockiness in the
 *     darker, further regions", where the relative variance is largest because
 *     the mean is smallest (this scene has NO environment: every photon is a
 *     lamp and a bounce);
 *   · the §12.43 root relaxes — evidence is no longer preserved across the
 *     sparse refresh, so at stride 5 the effective sample count per probe falls
 *     from ~250 frames to ~20. √12 ≈ 3.5× more noise, on the same lattice;
 *   · the per-probe ray cap lifts to OFF — the 3.8× deposit swing §12.45
 *     priced, paid for 60% of frames.
 *
 * THE FIX IS TO ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION. A light EVENT is not "fast" — it is
 * FASTER THAN THIS LIGHT HAS BEEN. So each term keeps a slow EMA of itself and
 * arms only when it clears `max(threshold, NOVELTY × its own baseline)`.
 *
 *   · a steadily rotating sun: term ≈ its own EMA ⇒ never novel ⇒ window shut,
 *     and responsiveness falls back to the m-driven α ramp, which is what
 *     §12.46 said should own this case all along;
 *   · a sun that STARTS moving, a teleport, a scrub: EMA is low ⇒ arms;
 *   · a lamp toggling mid-day-cycle: the EMA is PER TERM, so the sun's raised
 *     shadow baseline cannot mask a luminance event. This is why it is three
 *     baselines and not one — a single EMA over the max would have made the
 *     day cycle deaf to every other light in the scene.
 *
 * The EMA is fed the UNCLAMPED term (the clamp to 1 that `mLight` applies would
 * saturate a rotating sun and a teleport to the same number, and then a
 * teleport during a day cycle would not be novel either).
 *
 * NOT SHIPPED. It would close the straddle if a slower ease ever put the dips
 * past the 800 ms dwell (the ping-pong endpoints in §12.46's ledger are ~0.6 s
 * — closer than is comfortable), but on the measured configuration it is a
 * NO-OP, and inert complexity in the arming path is how this window got two
 * conflicting stories in the first place.

 * ══ THE RAY CEILING, AND WHY THE TRANSPORT CANNOT BE PRICED IN PIXELS ═══════
 *
 * `transportRays` is the most rays one frame may fire, full stop. Above it the
 * pixel set is STRIDED (`srcRays.js`'s [D1]/[D5]) with a per-frame rotating
 * phase, so the whole screen is still covered — over several frames, into an
 * accumulator that was built for exactly that (§12.23).
 *
 * It exists because everything else here is per-pixel and that turned out to be
 * a cost model, not just an addressing scheme. Population inserts a probe per
 * gbuffer pixel, [D1] gives each pixel `raysPerPixel` rays, and the deposit is
 * dispatched per pixel — so the transport's cost is the SCREEN's size, and
 * `giConfig.js` hands ultra `resolveScale: 1`. On the user's Sponza that is
 * 1,573,200 px × 2 = 3,146,400 rays per frame to service 5,692 live probes:
 * ~553 rays per probe, against the **0.78 rays/bin** §12.13 measured as this
 * design's own operating point. Measured cost, `profile.giPasses` on that
 * editor: the deposit is **249 ms of a 260 ms** SRC chain — 95.7% of it.
 *
 * `probe:gi-src-cost` swept transport pixels at ultra with the tier pinned:
 *
 *     rays      deposit ms   ns/ray   screen mean
 *     631,904      9.037      14.3      0.12733
 *     157,976      2.339      14.8      0.12380
 *
 *     least squares: deposit ms ≈ 0.547 + 13.4 ns × rays  ⇒ rays are 94% of it
 *
 * Four times fewer rays cost **2.8%** of screen mean. So this is a ceiling on
 * the thing that is 94% of the cost, bought at ~3% of the look.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE ARE CEILINGS, NOT TARGETS. `stride = max(1, ceil(rays / ceiling))`,
 * so a small viewport whose natural ray count is already under the ceiling gets
 * `stride = 1` and is bit-identical to the old behaviour. Every gate runs there.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THEY ARE NOT YET TUNED AGAINST THE USER'S MACHINE. The same kernel
 * measured **79 ns/ray** in their editor against **13.4** in the harness, both
 * at ultra — 5.5×, cause unestablished (thread-count cache pressure over the
 * 218 MB occupancy field and sustained-load clocks are the candidates; the

 * re-measured there. `globalThis.__giSrcTransportRays` is the A/B.

 * ══ THE PER-PROBE RAY CAP — §12.32.1's OPTION (1), DEFAULT ON high/ultra ═══
 *
 * The ceiling above bounds the FRAME; this bounds the PROBE. `probe:gi-src-cost
 * SWEEP=histo` measured why it exists (Sponza, high, nave pose): 2,432 live c0
 * probes shared 126,381 rays/frame with the MEDIAN probe firing 8 and the
 * fattest 1,794 — membership pricing sends ~80% of the budget to the few
 * probes whose bins converged long ago. Capping each c0 probe at B rays/frame:
 *
 *     cap B    Σmin(count,B) vs today     probes AT the cap
 *       8          0.105×                 41%

 *      32          0.261×                 19%
 *
 * THE DEFAULT (16 on high and ultra) IS GATED ON THE α COMPENSATION being in
 * the decay (§12.42): a hard cap alone concentrates its evidence cut on the
 * near-field, screen-filling probes and still-scene reversals rise like
 * √(ray cut) — 2.57×/3.06×/1.78× at high16/ultra16/ultra32, the §12.40.4
 * measurement that kept the cap opt-in for exactly one unit. With the
 * compensation holding each block's evidence window at its uncapped value,
 * the same rig reads the capped arm BELOW the off arm at all three points
 * (−27%/−15%/−10%), because the longer memory also carries starved bins
 * through influx gaps — §12.24's membership churn drops with it. Ship a cap
 * change ONLY through that rig; step p95 (+23–31%, fewer-but-chunkier
 * membership events) is the recorded residual, §12.24's floor. low/medium

 * 10.1 ms UNCAPPED deposit (62k rays for 1,046 live c0 probes — the coarse
 * low lattice concentrates ~60 rays on a mean probe, so the cap cuts MORE
 * here than the high/ultra arms it was priced on), and the α compensation
 * that makes the cut variance-neutral is tier-independent.
 *
 * The cap is a UNIFORM polled per frame (`__giSrcProbeRayCap` — a positive
 * number caps live, 0 forces OFF over the tier default, unset = the tier),
 * so every experiment is in-page. It is floored to a multiple of
 * raysPerPixel because [D5] hands out whole per-pixel slices; a non-multiple

 * ══ SURPRISE — THE CAP'S ESCAPE HATCH, AND ITS ONE SWITCH ══════════════════
 *
 * The per-probe cap above is a STEADY-STATE budget: a probe whose bins settled
 * long ago does not need 1,794 rays a frame. What it cannot price is a block
 * whose truth just MOVED — a light toggled, a mover crossed the wall behind it
 * — because the cap denies exactly the evidence rate that would let the
 * accumulator follow. §12.45 lifts the cap globally inside the light-event
 * window; this is the per-BLOCK version, driven by the block's own deposits
 * rather than by a scene-wide signal, so an occlusion change no light event can
 * see still gets its evidence.
 *
 * `u` ∈ [0,1] in `SURPRISE_ONE` fixed point, one word per block, is that
 * signal. It reaches two consumers:
 *
 *   DECAY   `keep′ = 1 − (1−keep)·mix(liftedRatio, SURPRISE_F, u)` — a
 *           surprised block forgets FASTER, up to the fast-α rate.
 *   CAP     `u ≥ SURPRISE_CAP_MIN` exempts the block's probe from the cap by
 *           `SURPRISE_CAP_SHIFT` (a SHIFT, so the exempted cap is still a
 *           multiple of raysPerPixel — see [D1']).
 *
 * ⚠ THEY ARE ONE SWITCH, AND THE CODE ENFORCES IT BY CONSTRUCTION. The
 * governor's `surpriseGain` multiplies `u` ONCE, in the publish that writes the
 * word — so both consumers read the same gained number and `gain = 0` means
 * `keep′ == keepCompensated` bit for bit AND no surprise-driven boost. A gain
 * applied at either consumer instead would let "forget faster" and "trace more"
 * drift apart, which is a decay that outruns its own evidence: the exact

 *
 * ══ WHY THIS IS A BUDGET AND NOT A CAPACITY ════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Bins used to be addressed by probe CAPACITY — one block per probe SLOT,
 * whether or not a probe ever existed there. That sized the accumulators off a
 * generous over-estimate (`expectedC0Probes` is a quarter of the pixel count,
 * floored at 16,384) and it did not survive contact with a real viewport: at a
 * half-res 1080p gbuffer the c0 capacity is 131,072 slots, which is 16.8 M bins
 * and **604 MB** — past the 128 MiB binding limit by five times, i.e. the
 * constructor would have thrown before the first frame.
 *
 * §12.16's gate measured the waste directly: **0.24% of allocated bins were
 * ever sampled.** So blocks are claimed by LIVE probes out of a pool, and the
 * pool is sized by this budget rather than by the slot count.
 *
 * ══ THE SPLIT IS EQUAL BINS PER CASCADE, AND THAT IS MEASURED ══════════════
 *
 * Probe counts fall ~4× per cascade (spacing doubles on a 2D surface manifold)
 * while bins rise exactly 4× (β = 4). The two cancel, so every cascade wants
 * the same TOTAL bin count — §12.13.4 measured the consequence as 0.78 rays per
 * bin at every cascade, flat. An equal split is therefore the shape of the
 * data, not a convenience.
 *
 * 1.4 M bins is ~48 MB at 9 words per bin (5 scratch + 4 payload), which is the
 * §12.18.3 target, and it buys 10,937 c0 blocks — above the ~10,000 live c0
 * probes §12.18.2 estimates for a Sponza-class interior after `LOD0_REACH`.
 * That estimate is the thing to re-measure when the LOD law lands: the claim
 * failure is COUNTED (`COUNTER_NOBLOCK`), so a pool that turns out too small
 * says so instead of producing an unexplained dark patch.
 *
 * ══ RE-MEASURED 2026-08-17 ON BISTRO, AND IT WAS TOO SMALL ════════════════
 *
 * The counter did its job and the number above was the one that was wrong. A
 * CITY STREET is not a Sponza-class interior: the user's Bistro runs **14,273
 * live c0 probes** against the 10,937 blocks 1.4 M buys, so ~3,300 c0 probes
 * are permanently blockless — alive, keyed, ray-budgeted, with nowhere to
 * deposit — and the deposit-side counter read `noBlock 37255` PER FRAME.
 * c1/c2/c3 were starved by the same ~1.3× (live 3788/1006/279 against
 * 2734/683/170). This is the user's **moving black patches**: which probes
 * win a block is birth order, so every camera move reshuffles the losers and
 * the dark cells crawl over the surfaces.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GROW PATH MADE IT WORSE, AND THAT IS THE PART TO REMEMBER. Slot
 * pressure doubled `c0Probes` 16384→32768 while `binBudget` was already
 * pinned at this ceiling (the log line reads `binBudget 1400000→1400000`),
 * so the rebuild bought MORE probes to share the SAME 10,937 blocks. A
 * bigger slot pool with a capped bin pool is strictly more black.
 *
 * 2.8 M bins ≈ 100 MB, which still clears the 128 MiB binding limit that
 * killed the old capacity-addressed sizing, and buys 21,875 c0 blocks —
 * above the measured 14,273 with room for the slot pool's next double. Both
 * pools remain FLOORS-first (`SRC_POOL_FLOORS.binBudget` is still 700 k), so

 * How far LOD 0 reaches, in units of s₀ — the distance at which s₀ stops being
 * a fine enough probe spacing and the lattice is allowed to double.
 *
 * ══ THE CONSTANT THAT WAS MISSING, AND WHAT ITS ABSENCE DID ════════════════
 *
 * `lodAtDistance` used to be `log2(cheb / s₀)`, i.e. this constant fixed at 1.
 * Compose that with `probeSpacing(0, lod, s₀) = s₀·2^lod` and the result is
 * **spacing ≈ the camera distance**: LOD 0 applied within 0.45 m of the camera
 * at the shipping s₀ and everything beyond it was coarsened in proportion to
 * how far away it was. Angular probe spacing was therefore a constant ~1
 * radian — 57° — where it needs to be a fraction of a degree, and that is why
 * §12.17's Cornell render is made of rectangles. The capacity was never the
 * problem; the LAW was.
 *
 * The value is derivable rather than tuned: `LOD0_REACH = s₀/α` for a target
 * angular spacing α, and α ≈ 1/64 rad (0.9°) gives 64. It matches
 * `REANCHOR_CHEBYSHEV`'s 64·s₀ and that is not a coincidence — both answer
 * "how far out does the LOD-0 lattice have to stay usable".
 *
 * A POWER OF TWO ON PURPOSE. The twins must agree bit-for-bit
 * (`test:gi-src-math`), and `s₀·64` is exact in f32 and f64 alike, so the two
 * implementations cannot drift on the multiply this constant introduces.
 *
 * 128 was the other end of §12.18.2's range and is rejected by arithmetic:
 * halving the angular spacing quadruples the probe count, which puts a
 * Sponza-class interior at ~40,000 c0 probes — past both the 16,384 slot
 * capacity and the block pool. 64 lands it at ~10,000.

/**
 * §12.90b — LOD 0's REACH IS IN METRES, and `LOD0_REACH` is in CELLS.
 *
 * The constant above is an ANGULAR criterion (s₀/α at α ≈ 1/64 rad), which is
 * why it is expressed in cells — and that is correct while s₀ is a per-tier
 * constant. It stops being correct the moment §12.90 derives s₀ from the scene:
 * refining s₀ 0.45 → 0.35 pulls LOD 0's reach 28.8 m → **22.4 m**, so on the
 * user's 28 m house the far end drops to LOD 1 at 0.70 m spacing — COARSER than
 * the 0.45 m it had before the "improvement". A fix aimed at through-wall leaks
 * would have made "further regions look worse", which is the user's original
 * complaint, arriving by a new route.
 *
 * The same trap as `REANCHOR_CHEBYSHEV` (srcSystem), and the same fix: pin the
 * REACH, let the cell count follow. Holding 28.8 m at s₀ = 0.35 means LOD 0's
 * angular spacing is 1/82 rad — FINER than the 1/64 target, i.e. strictly more
 * quality for the probes the finer lattice was already spending. It is not a
 * violation of the criterion; it is the criterion being over-satisfied.
 *
 * ONE reader, read by BOTH twins (`lodAtDistance` here and in srcMathTsl), so
 * the GPU and CPU forms of the lattice cannot drift apart.
