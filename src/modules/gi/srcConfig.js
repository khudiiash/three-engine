//
// docs/GI_SRC_REBUILD_PLAN.md §2 / §4. Pure JS, no three, no TSL: every
// consumer (CPU reference, GPU kernels, telemetry, tests) derives its numbers
// from HERE so there is exactly one definition of the hierarchy. A second
// place that computes an interval boundary is a leak waiting to be measured.
//
// ══ THE TWO SCALING FACTORS ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// β = 4  angular branching: |D_{i+1}| = 4·|D_i|, and the 4→1 parent mapping is
//        integer halving on the 2w×w bin grid (srcMath.binParent).
// γ = 4  interval scaling:  L_{i+1} = 4·L_i.
//
// BOTH, simultaneously — that is the paper's core theoretical claim (§3.2,
// Appendix A): the estimator minimizes `max(spatial error α, angular error ε)`
// only when ε scales WITH α. γ=2 lets angular error dominate the far cascades.
//
// This module previously ran BRANCH=2, and BRANCH=4 was rejected twice (see
// the plan's §11 decision log). Those rejections were measured on the DENSE
// LATTICE with the parallax merge kernel at c0DirRes 2–4 — a regime where
// angular resolution could not be raised to compensate. The merge here is
// count-weighted sparse with pre-averaging and no parallax re-aim, which is a
// different estimator; the falloff/chroma probes that produced the original
// rejections re-gate this one. If γ=4 fails them HERE that is a real finding
// to take upstream, not a config to quietly fudge.
//
// ══ SPACING vs INTERVAL — the one spatial dial ═══════════════════════════════
//
// `spacing0` (s₀) is THE live spatial dial (session-36 lesson: one dial, not
// a family of interacting ones). r₀ is DERIVED from it at a fixed ratio, so a
// user dragging spacing never desynchronizes the two.

 * banner). Normalising fixes the SCALE; it does not fix the GAPS. The matrix is
 * written by a script whose tick is not the GI tick, so on some frames the
 * delta is zero and on the next it is two frames' worth — and a zero frame is
 * indistinguishable, to every consumer, from a light that stopped.
 *
 * Measured live in the user's own play session, on a sun turning at a smooth
 * sinusoidal rate (`profile.flicker`'s `lightMotion` dial, in units of the
 * tracking window's own 0.5 threshold): **median 0.337, maximum 3.451** — an
 * 11× spread on a light whose angular velocity barely changes across the
 * window. That spread is what walks the signal back and forth across the arm
 * threshold, and §12.83's simulation of the same straddle assumed ±12 %.
 *
 * So the rate is peak-held with an exponential release: a genuine light STEP
 * passes in the frame it happens (an average would lag it by a whole time
 * constant — the thing §12.38.3 was built to stop), and the zeros between two
 * script writes are filled instead of read as stillness. 100 ms is ~6 frames at

 * ══ THE TRACKING WINDOW — WHY A SEEN CHANGE HOLDS α UP (§12.43) ═════════════
 *
 * The motion signal is INSTANTANEOUS: a lamp toggle is one frame of luminance
 * delta, so α spiked for ~a frame and the field's actual convergence ran at
 * the still floor — with §12.42's compensation re-engaged on capped blocks.
 * Measured (`probe:gi-src-converge`, Cornell, intensity 2→6): t90 = 0.48 s
 * with cap+comp off, 1.65 s shipped at stride 1, and **7.42 s at stride 12**,
 * the ultra/fullscreen regime — the user's "temporal is way too slow", twice
 * reported, in one table.
 *
 * Two coupled mechanisms, one switch (`__giSrcMotionTrack = false` restores
 * both old behaviours), and both arm on LIGHT EVENTS ONLY — light matrix
 * motion, luminance deltas, emitter changes — NEVER on mover displacement:
 *
 *  1. PEAK-HOLD (GISystem's `sceneMotion` closure): a light-side peak ≥
 *     ALPHA_TRACK_THRESHOLD arms a window of ALPHA_TRACK_HOLD_MS during
 *     which the closure reports the held peak — α (and §12.42's lift) stay
 *     at the change's level while the field actually converges instead of
 *     for the one frame the delta itself lasts.
 *  2. THE STRIDE ROOT RELAXES INSIDE THE WINDOW (srcSystem.syncCamera,
 *     via the `trackMotion` getter): `keep = (1−α)^(1/(1+(S−1)·(1−tr)))`,
 *     `tr` = the held light peak while the window is open, 0 otherwise. At
 *     tr = 1 the root is gone — a LIGHT change invalidates the WHOLE field,
 *     so preserving its history is not stability, it is lag.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY LIGHT-SIDE ONLY IS LOAD-BEARING, NOT A PREFERENCE. The first draft
 * armed on ANY motion peak and tied the root to α's own ramp position, and
 * TRACK_AB refuted it the day it was written: moving arms 21.5 vs 1.0
 * rev/px, and the STILL controls 21.2 vs 0.92 — the mover term spikes
 * spuriously on a parked ultra scene (§12.42.4's lift snapshot read 0.944
 * on a still arm before any tracking code existed), and a hold turns every
 * spike from one frame of raised α into a 1.2 s burst of relaxed-root fast
 * decay. The user saw that build as "the floor is covered in water". An
 * object's motion also only invalidates the field LOCALLY (the sources are
 * unchanged); movers keep §12.38's shipped behaviour exactly.

 *    per frame, every frame) saturates the peak permanently. Level-triggered
 *    arming re-pushed the hold each frame, so the window NEVER closed during
 *    play — §12.45's cap lift became permanent (the §12.42 fps win cancelled
 *    for the whole session) and the window's fast decay became the steady
 *    state. LIGHT_ROT priced the regimes: level-armed 4.62 rev/px at
 *    capLift 100% vs window-off 5.07 at capLift 0 — SAME churn, tier-capped
 *    cost — while no-lift's 30.9 confirms the lift must exist wherever level

 * ⛔ §12.83 — A NOVELTY GATE WAS BUILT HERE AND BACKED OUT THE SAME HOUR. THE
 * PREMISE WAS A MISREAD LOG LINE, AND THE MISREADING IS THE THING WORTH
 * KEEPING (2026-08-23).
 *
 * The live receipt from the user's editor reads
 *
 *     [gi] light-track window: 1 arms in 2.0s (0.5/s), open 60% of 121 frames
 *          — armed by shadow 1, peak 0.53 (threshold 0.5)
 *
 * and "open 60% of frames" was read — here, in `gi-walk-transient`, and in the
 * plan's §12.82 banner ("open 43-58% of frames") — as a STEADY STATE: the
 * window open most of the time, flushing the screen irradiance filter and
 * lifting the ray cap for most of every second of play. That reading is wrong.
 * **The line is a ~2 s TALLY and it is printed ONLY when the window armed or
 * was open during that tally**, so "open 60%" is one 1200 ms hold inside one
 * 2 s span, and the spans in between print NOTHING. On the user's Level those
 * two lines are THREE MINUTES apart with silence between: two arms in ~210 s
 * = a **~1% duty cycle**, not 60%.
 *
 * §12.46's rising-edge arm is therefore doing its job. A simulation of the
 * exact arming block against their own day cycle (0.1 rad/s → a shadow term
 * of 0.52 at 72 fps, straddling the 0.5 threshold) with ±12% frame-rate
 * jitter: 1 arm and 2% open in 60 s. The straddle cannot re-arm because the
 * dips are ONE FRAME long and the dwell wants 800 ms of them.
 *
 * So: do not spend a unit on this window. Its cost is ~1% of frames, and the
 * §12.82 banner's "⭐ (3) is the next unit" rests on the same misreading and
 * is withdrawn. ⚠ The general trap: a periodic tally that suppresses its own
 * empty prints reads as a duty cycle and is a RATE — check the timestamps
 * between lines before believing a percentage.
 *
 * ── the original design, kept because the hole is real if narrow ───────────
 *
 * §12.46 (above) established the intent in as many words: *sustained motion
 * needs no window*. Its instrument was a RISING EDGE against a fixed absolute
 * threshold, and that instrument only works when the sustained signal sits
 * clearly above the threshold — then the edge never re-fires.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT WORK WHEN THE SIGNAL STRADDLES THE THRESHOLD, and the user's own
 * Level does exactly that. A day cycle at 0.1 rad/s puts `shadowMotion /
 * ALPHA_MOTION_SAT` at ~0.62 at 60 fps and ~0.37 at 100 fps — so ordinary frame-
 * rate jitter walks the peak back and forth across 0.5, each dip clears the
 * 800 ms dwell, and the next rise arms a fresh 1200 ms window. The live receipt
 * from the user's editor, twice, minutes apart:
 *
 *     [gi] light-track window: 1 arms in 2.0s (0.5/s), open 60% of 121 frames
 *          — armed by shadow 1, peak 0.53 (threshold 0.5)
 *
 * i.e. the window is open **~60% of every second of play** for a sun that is
 * doing nothing eventful. What that costs, all three at once:
 *
 *   · `_giIrrHistWeightU = 0` (GISystem ~2262) — the §12.65 screen irradiance
 *     temporal filter is FLUSHED, so the raw gather goes to the screen and the
 *     c0 probe lattice's own per-probe variance is the picture. At s₀ = 0.45 m
 *     that is a ~0.45 m tent on every surface — the user's "blockiness in the
 *     darker, further regions", where the relative variance is largest because
 *     the mean is smallest (this scene has NO environment: every photon is a
 *     lamp and a bounce);
 *   · the §12.43 root relaxes — evidence is no longer preserved across the
 *     sparse refresh, so at stride 5 the effective sample count per probe falls
 *     from ~250 frames to ~20. √12 ≈ 3.5× more noise, on the same lattice;
 *   · the per-probe ray cap lifts to OFF — the 3.8× deposit swing §12.45
 *     priced, paid for 60% of frames.
 *
 * THE FIX IS TO ASK A DIFFERENT QUESTION. A light EVENT is not "fast" — it is
 * FASTER THAN THIS LIGHT HAS BEEN. So each term keeps a slow EMA of itself and
 * arms only when it clears `max(threshold, NOVELTY × its own baseline)`.
 *
 *   · a steadily rotating sun: term ≈ its own EMA ⇒ never novel ⇒ window shut,
 *     and responsiveness falls back to the m-driven α ramp, which is what
 *     §12.46 said should own this case all along;
 *   · a sun that STARTS moving, a teleport, a scrub: EMA is low ⇒ arms;
 *   · a lamp toggling mid-day-cycle: the EMA is PER TERM, so the sun's raised
 *     shadow baseline cannot mask a luminance event. This is why it is three
 *     baselines and not one — a single EMA over the max would have made the
 *     day cycle deaf to every other light in the scene.
 *
 * The EMA is fed the UNCLAMPED term (the clamp to 1 that `mLight` applies would
 * saturate a rotating sun and a teleport to the same number, and then a
 * teleport during a day cycle would not be novel either).
 *
 * NOT SHIPPED. It would close the straddle if a slower ease ever put the dips
 * past the 800 ms dwell (the ping-pong endpoints in §12.46's ledger are ~0.6 s
 * — closer than is comfortable), but on the measured configuration it is a
 * NO-OP, and inert complexity in the arming path is how this window got two
 * conflicting stories in the first place.

 * ══ THE RAY CEILING, AND WHY THE TRANSPORT CANNOT BE PRICED IN PIXELS ═══════
 *
 * `transportRays` is the most rays one frame may fire, full stop. Above it the
 * pixel set is STRIDED (`srcRays.js`'s [D1]/[D5]) with a per-frame rotating
 * phase, so the whole screen is still covered — over several frames, into an
 * accumulator that was built for exactly that (§12.23).
 *
 * It exists because everything else here is per-pixel and that turned out to be
 * a cost model, not just an addressing scheme. Population inserts a probe per
 * gbuffer pixel, [D1] gives each pixel `raysPerPixel` rays, and the deposit is
 * dispatched per pixel — so the transport's cost is the SCREEN's size, and
 * `giConfig.js` hands ultra `resolveScale: 1`. On the user's Sponza that is
 * 1,573,200 px × 2 = 3,146,400 rays per frame to service 5,692 live probes:
 * ~553 rays per probe, against the **0.78 rays/bin** §12.13 measured as this
 * design's own operating point. Measured cost, `profile.giPasses` on that
 * editor: the deposit is **249 ms of a 260 ms** SRC chain — 95.7% of it.
 *
 * `probe:gi-src-cost` swept transport pixels at ultra with the tier pinned:
 *
 *     rays      deposit ms   ns/ray   screen mean
 *     631,904      9.037      14.3      0.12733
 *     157,976      2.339      14.8      0.12380
 *
 *     least squares: deposit ms ≈ 0.547 + 13.4 ns × rays  ⇒ rays are 94% of it
 *
 * Four times fewer rays cost **2.8%** of screen mean. So this is a ceiling on
 * the thing that is 94% of the cost, bought at ~3% of the look.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE ARE CEILINGS, NOT TARGETS. `stride = max(1, ceil(rays / ceiling))`,

 * probes shared 126,381 rays/frame with the MEDIAN probe firing 8 and the

 *
 * THE DEFAULT (16 on high and ultra) IS GATED ON THE α COMPENSATION being in
 * the decay (§12.42): a hard cap alone concentrates its evidence cut on the
 * near-field, screen-filling probes and still-scene reversals rise like

 * (−27%/−15%/−10%), because the longer memory also carries starved bins
 * through influx gaps — §12.24's membership churn drops with it. Ship a cap

 * here than the high/ultra arms it was priced on), and the α compensation
 * that makes the cut variance-neutral is tier-independent.
 *
 * The cap is a UNIFORM polled per frame (`__giSrcProbeRayCap` — a positive

 * whose truth just MOVED — a light toggled, a mover crossed the wall behind it
 * — because the cap denies exactly the evidence rate that would let the

 * window; this is the per-BLOCK version, driven by the block's own deposits
 * rather than by a scene-wide signal, so an occlusion change no light event can
 * see still gets its evidence.

 *
 * ══ WHY THIS IS A BUDGET AND NOT A CAPACITY ════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Bins used to be addressed by probe CAPACITY — one block per probe SLOT,
 * whether or not a probe ever existed there. That sized the accumulators off a
 * generous over-estimate (`expectedC0Probes` is a quarter of the pixel count,
 * floored at 16,384) and it did not survive contact with a real viewport: at a
 * half-res 1080p gbuffer the c0 capacity is 131,072 slots, which is 16.8 M bins
 * and **604 MB** — past the 128 MiB binding limit by five times, i.e. the
 * constructor would have thrown before the first frame.
 *
 * §12.16's gate measured the waste directly: **0.24% of allocated bins were
 * ever sampled.** So blocks are claimed by LIVE probes out of a pool, and the
 * pool is sized by this budget rather than by the slot count.
 *
 * ══ THE SPLIT IS EQUAL BINS PER CASCADE, AND THAT IS MEASURED ══════════════
 *
 * Probe counts fall ~4× per cascade (spacing doubles on a 2D surface manifold)
 * while bins rise exactly 4× (β = 4). The two cancel, so every cascade wants
 * the same TOTAL bin count — §12.13.4 measured the consequence as 0.78 rays per
 * bin at every cascade, flat. An equal split is therefore the shape of the
 * data, not a convenience.
 *
 * 1.4 M bins is ~48 MB at 9 words per bin (5 scratch + 4 payload), which is the
 * §12.18.3 target, and it buys 10,937 c0 blocks — above the ~10,000 live c0
 * probes §12.18.2 estimates for a Sponza-class interior after `LOD0_REACH`.
 * That estimate is the thing to re-measure when the LOD law lands: the claim
 * failure is COUNTED (`COUNTER_NOBLOCK`), so a pool that turns out too small
 * says so instead of producing an unexplained dark patch.
 *
 * ══ RE-MEASURED 2026-08-17 ON BISTRO, AND IT WAS TOO SMALL ════════════════
 *
 * The counter did its job and the number above was the one that was wrong. A
 * CITY STREET is not a Sponza-class interior: the user's Bistro runs **14,273
 * live c0 probes** against the 10,937 blocks 1.4 M buys, so ~3,300 c0 probes
 * are permanently blockless — alive, keyed, ray-budgeted, with nowhere to
 * deposit — and the deposit-side counter read `noBlock 37255` PER FRAME.
 * c1/c2/c3 were starved by the same ~1.3× (live 3788/1006/279 against
 * 2734/683/170). This is the user's **moving black patches**: which probes
 * win a block is birth order, so every camera move reshuffles the losers and
 * the dark cells crawl over the surfaces.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GROW PATH MADE IT WORSE, AND THAT IS THE PART TO REMEMBER. Slot
 * pressure doubled `c0Probes` 16384→32768 while `binBudget` was already
 * pinned at this ceiling (the log line reads `binBudget 1400000→1400000`),
 * so the rebuild bought MORE probes to share the SAME 10,937 blocks. A
 * bigger slot pool with a capped bin pool is strictly more black.
 *
 * 2.8 M bins ≈ 100 MB, which still clears the 128 MiB binding limit that
 * killed the old capacity-addressed sizing, and buys 21,875 c0 blocks —
 * above the measured 14,273 with room for the slot pool's next double. Both
 * pools remain FLOORS-first (`SRC_POOL_FLOORS.binBudget` is still 700 k), so
 * a scene that does not ask pays nothing; this is only where growth stops.

  //
  // The mechanism is §12.82's own caveat, which this session under-weighted:

 * `BIN_BUDGET` above fits ONE storage binding under WebGPU's portable default
 * of 128 MiB. That default is what a phone offers; the user's desktop adapter
 * advertises 2047 MB, `sceneSettings.resolveRendererLimits` already asks it
 * for 1 GiB, and `GISystem` already reads `device.limits` to degrade the field
 * buffer — but the SRC store never looked, so on Bistro cascade 0 rationed
 * 35 156 blocks against ~43 500 wanted on a street sweep while the device had
 * 1.8 GB unasked-for. The retention valve then retired the probes behind the
 * camera to make room, and turning back re-minted them cold: the "dead probes
 * appear black as we rotate" report, plan §11.2.
 *
 * So the ceiling is a FUNCTION of the device limit: the most bins whose
 * `scratch` (BIN_WORDS per bin, plus [J]'s hit list and the per-block
 * statistics, which ride the same buffer — `reserveBytes`) fits one binding,
 * and whose payload fits its own. The grow ladder climbs toward it ON DEMAND
 * only, so a small scene on a big GPU allocates exactly what it did before.
 * `BIN_CEILING_MAX` bounds a runaway: 16 M bins is ~320 MB of scratch and
 * ~128 MB of payload, a 200 k-probe cascade 0 — past that the answer is a
 * coarser lattice, not more memory.

 *
 * ══ THE CONSTANT THAT WAS MISSING, AND WHAT ITS ABSENCE DID ════════════════
 *
 * `lodAtDistance` used to be `log2(cheb / s₀)`, i.e. this constant fixed at 1.
 * Compose that with `probeSpacing(0, lod, s₀) = s₀·2^lod` and the result is
 * **spacing ≈ the camera distance**: LOD 0 applied within 0.45 m of the camera
 * at the shipping s₀ and everything beyond it was coarsened in proportion to
 * how far away it was. Angular probe spacing was therefore a constant ~1
 * radian — 57° — where it needs to be a fraction of a degree, and that is why
 * §12.17's Cornell render is made of rectangles. The capacity was never the
 * problem; the LAW was.
 *
 * The value is derivable rather than tuned: `LOD0_REACH = s₀/α` for a target
 * angular spacing α, and α ≈ 1/64 rad (0.9°) gives 64. It matches
 * `REANCHOR_CHEBYSHEV`'s 64·s₀ and that is not a coincidence — both answer
 * "how far out does the LOD-0 lattice have to stay usable".
 *
 * A POWER OF TWO ON PURPOSE. The twins must agree bit-for-bit
 * (`test:gi-src-math`), and `s₀·64` is exact in f32 and f64 alike, so the two
 * implementations cannot drift on the multiply this constant introduces.
 *
 * 128 was the other end of §12.18.2's range and is rejected by arithmetic:
 * halving the angular spacing quadruples the probe count, which puts a
 * Sponza-class interior at ~40,000 c0 probes — past both the 16,384 slot
 * capacity and the block pool. 64 lands it at ~10,000.
 */

/**
 * §12.90b — LOD 0's REACH IS IN METRES, and `LOD0_REACH` is in CELLS.
 *
 * The constant above is an ANGULAR criterion (s₀/α at α ≈ 1/64 rad), which is
 * why it is expressed in cells — and that is correct while s₀ is a per-tier
 * constant. It stops being correct the moment §12.90 derives s₀ from the scene:
 * refining s₀ 0.45 → 0.35 pulls LOD 0's reach 28.8 m → **22.4 m**, so on the
 * user's 28 m house the far end drops to LOD 1 at 0.70 m spacing — COARSER than
 * the 0.45 m it had before the "improvement". A fix aimed at through-wall leaks
 * would have made "further regions look worse", which is the user's original
 * complaint, arriving by a new route.
 *
 * The same trap as `REANCHOR_CHEBYSHEV` (srcSystem), and the same fix: pin the
 * REACH, let the cell count follow. Holding 28.8 m at s₀ = 0.35 means LOD 0's
 * angular spacing is 1/82 rad — FINER than the 1/64 target, i.e. strictly more
 * quality for the probes the finer lattice was already spending. It is not a
 * violation of the criterion; it is the criterion being over-satisfied.
