//
// docs/GI_SRC_REBUILD_PLAN.md §4.1 [J], §4.4, §12.39, §12.26.9, §12.53.
//
// ══ WHY THE SHADING IS HERE AND NOT IN [E] (§12.53) ═════════════════════════
//
// [E] traced, shaded and scattered in one kernel, and that kernel was 179 kB of
// WGSL — ONE pipeline measured at 49-56 s of a cold boot, which is the user's
// entire "GI takes 30 s to 3 minutes to start" complaint in one number. The
// shading is what made it big: the visibility marcher is a two-nested-loop BVH8
// descent instantiated at two call sites (§13.14.5 priced a call site at ~1.2 s
// of compile), plus four rolled light slots, plus the NEE emitter set and its
// analytic shapes. None of it needs the trace — it needs a point, a normal, an
// albedo, an emission and a ray index, which is a 16-word record.
//
// §13.17's measurement is the argument: two ~75 kB kernels compiling in
// parallel beat one 177 kB monster by MORE than the byte ratio. So [E] traces,
// attributes and appends; [J] shades, gathers and deposits. Same estimator,
// same frame, same bins — the partition is drawn through the DEPOSIT, not
// through the physics:
//
//     below the hit (c < own)   T = 1, no radiance         [E]
//     at the hit    (c == own)  count now, radiance here   [E] + [J]
//     a miss        (own == N)  T = 1 everywhere           [E]
//     the sky                   composited once at [G]     unchanged
//
// It also stops paying for the ~76% of rays that MISS: the un-split kernel
// called `shadeHit` on every ray and let `own == N` throw the answer away.
//
// ══ WHY THE BOUNCE IS A PASS AND NOT A LINE IN `srcShade.js` ════════════════
//
// It was a line in `srcShade.js`, for one session, and the user's editor priced
// it the same hour: `gatherAt` is 16 hash-find loops and 16 filtered tile taps,
// and the hit shader was instantiated INSIDE the deposit's ray loop — the
// fattest kernel in the module. The deposit went 58 kB → 323 kB of WGSL (2 → 3
// loops, 642 ifs) and its pipeline compile went to **48 SECONDS**, the §13.14
// unroll pathology this module has now paid to learn three times.
//
// The plan's own [J] line said the architecture out loud — "steps B–H re-run
// over LAST FRAME'S HIT POINTS" — and that is a compact worklist with the
// gather compiled ONCE, in a small kernel, dispatched over hits instead of over
// (rays × call sites). Same estimator, same frame, same bins.
//
// ══ FOUR STORAGE BINDINGS, AND EACH ONE IS LOAD-BEARING (R7) ════════════════
//
//   1. `scratch` — the hit list AND the bins AND the per-block evidence words.
//      ONE buffer, because [J]'s inputs ride the tail of the accumulators it
//      writes (`srcDeposit.js`'s SEC_* layout). A separate list buffer would
//      have cost [E] its last binding.
//   2. `hashKeys` — the whole corner lookup, keys and the hash→block words
//      together, via `createSrcHashBlockFrame`'s single-buffer `lookup`. BUILT
//      ONLY WHEN THE BOUNCE IS ON: with `__giSrcSecondary = false` there is no
//      gather, so this binding does not exist and [J] compiles with three.
//   3. `stats` — the deposit's counters. [J] owns no buffer, exactly as
//      `createSrcShadeCounters` arranged for the hit shader.
//   4. the occupancy field's `bits` — the visibility marcher, which arrived
//      with the shading in §12.53. ONE buffer for the whole medium: the
//      pyramid, the surface-record pool and the triangle pool are regions of a
//      single allocation (`occupancyField.js` says why, and it is the same R7
//      argument as the hit list riding `scratch`).
//
// [E] was at 8 of 8 before this unit and is still at 8 — it keeps the marcher
// for its primary rays, so nothing was taken off it and nothing was added.
//
// The tile atlas is a TEXTURE and textures are not part of the 8-storage-buffer
// budget, which is the whole reason the atlas exists in that form.
//
// ══ WHY BETWEEN [E] AND [F], AND NOT ANYWHERE ELSE ══════════════════════════
//
// · AFTER [E], necessarily: the list does not exist until [E] writes it.
// · BEFORE [F], necessarily: the resolve turns the accumulators into the
//   payload, and a deposit that lands after it is a frame late — and not merely
//   late, because the bin slot itself expires. [C] re-claims blocks every
//   frame, so an entry's `SEC_SLOT` is only meaningful inside the frame that
//   produced it.
// · `hashBlockFrame.pass` does NOT move for this. It already runs before the
//   first ray (§12.39: the hash LAYOUT is rebuilt every frame with
//   scheduler-dependent contention, so the tail must be republished after
//   compaction), and that placement is exactly what [J] needs as well.
//
// ══ THE ATLAS IS LAST FRAME'S, AND THAT IS THE ESTIMATOR ════════════════════
//
// [H] bakes AFTER the deposit each frame, so at the moment this pass samples a
// tile the atlas holds the PREVIOUS frame's irradiance. That lag is not a
// compromise, it is the fixed-point iteration R4 models: frame k's bounce reads
// frame k−1's field, the in-loop gain is `clampLoopAlbedo`'s ceiling (0.9,
// measured at 0.9000 in the CPU mirror), and the series converges to the full
// multibounce sum at one cache's cost. There is no separate, coarser secondary
// cache — §12.26.9 measured the same-spacing one as the LEAST leaky (coarsening
// BRIGHTENS: the trilinear near-geometry leak scales with probe spacing, and it
// is one-sided inside a feedback loop), so re-reading the primary lattice is
// the accurate choice rather than merely the free one.
//
// ══ THE SPLIT CLAMP IS GONE, AND §12.53 IS WHY ═════════════════════════════
//
// §12.39-§12.49 clamped the primary term in [E] and the secondary term here,
// separately, so a bin could receive up to 2·Lmax where the inline form gave
// Lmax. That was accepted and counted. It is now moot: both terms are computed
// in THIS kernel, so they are summed and clamped ONCE — the inline arithmetic,
// recovered as a side effect of moving the shading rather than as a fix.
//
// `STAT_SEC_CLAMPED` keeps its slot with its real subject: the BOUNCE TERM
// ALONE reaching the ceiling. That is the R4 reading — `ρ/π · E_atlas` with
// ρ ≤ 0.9 saturating on its own means the loop's gain is running away — and it
// costs one compare, because the term is already held separately so that the
// direct half can be handed to the shared `srcShade.js` closure unchanged.
//
// ⛔ THE DISPATCH IS DIRECT AND STAYS DIRECT. An indirect dispatch over the
// count word is the obvious optimization and it has been refuted TWICE on this
// module's own kernels (`srcDeposit.js`'s dispatch note) — the second time it
// shipped an editor where [E] launched zero workgroups with no error at all.
// The trailing threads here return in whole warps off one atomic load, which is
// the same shape the ray worklist made cheap.
