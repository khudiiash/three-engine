// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — [G] THE MERGE. This is what gives GI its RANGE.
//
// Cascade N−1 → 0, Eq. 6/7. Each bin keeps its own interval and lets through
// whatever it did not block from the sparse-trilinear-interpolated, 4→1
// pre-averaged cascade above it:
//
//     L_merged = L_self + T_self · L_parent
//     T_merged = T_self · T_parent
//
// with the TOP cascade merging against the sky, because there is nothing above
// it to interpolate. `srcMath.js`'s `mergeBin` is that one line and
// `srcRef.js`'s `mergeCascades` is the whole ladder; this file is the GPU twin
// of the ladder, and `test:gi-src-merge` diffs the two.
//
// ══ WHY THIS UNIT COMES BEFORE THE SMOOTH GATHER, AND IT IS NOT ORDERING ═══
//
// §12.19.5 argued it and it is worth carrying here, next to the code, because
// the shortcut is genuinely tempting: a position-indexed sparse-trilinear
// gather over cascade 0 alone would remove the visible blockiness a unit
// earlier. It would also be SHORT-RANGE — cascade 0's interval is r₀ ≈ 1.6·s₀,
// about a metre — so the result reads as smooth ambient occlusion rather than
// as global illumination. The merge is what makes a c0 bin's answer stretch to
// the far end of cascade 3, which at `LOD0_REACH = 64` is tens of metres.
//
// ══ WHAT IT CHANGES ON SCREEN TODAY, WHICH IS MORE THAN IT LOOKS ═══════════
//
// Hit shading is still Phase 5, so every deposited `L` is zero and the only
// term that survives is transmittance. Run that through the ladder:
//
//     top:  L = 0 + T_top·sky,     T = 0
//     c2:   L = 0 + T_c2·(sky·T_top),  T = T_c2·0 = 0
//     …
//     c0:   L = sky · Π T_i,       T = 0
//
// The c0-only gather this sits behind computed `sky·T_c0` — sky visibility over
// ONE metre. After the merge it is the product of transmittance along the whole
// cascade chain, i.e. sky visibility over the whole reach. Same estimator, four
// levels of range, and that difference is the entire visible payoff of [G].
//
// ══ `srcGather.js` NEEDS NO CHANGE, AND THE REASON IS WORTH STATING ════════
//
// The gather composites `L + T·sky` per bin. After the merge that expression is
// correct in both of the cases it can now meet, which is why nothing there had
// to learn about this file:
//
//   • a fully merged bin has T = 0, so the sky term vanishes and `L` — which
//     already carries the sky down the chain — stands alone. NO DOUBLE COUNT.
//   • a bin whose parent chain broke (no corner probe existed) keeps its own
//     T, and `L_self + T_self·sky` is exactly the c0-only answer it had before.
//
// So a missing parent degrades to the previous behaviour rather than to black,
// which is R1 (an absence is an absence) falling out of the arithmetic instead
// of being coded for.
//
// ══ THE THREE STRUCTURAL DECISIONS ═════════════════════════════════════════
//
// 1. **IT MERGES IN PLACE.** Cascade c's dispatch reads cascade c+1's region of
//    `payload` — written by the PREVIOUS dispatch — and writes only its own.
//    No thread reads the region it writes, and the dispatch boundary between
//    levels is the barrier that makes the read legal. A second buffer would be
//    another 22 MB at the engine default to hold values that are dead the
//    moment the level below has consumed them.
//
// 2. **THE 8 CORNERS ARE RESOLVED ONCE PER PROBE, NOT ONCE PER BIN.** The
//    trilinear corner set is a property of the probe's POSITION, so hoisting it
//    out turns 8 hash lookups per bin into 8 per probe — a factor of `binCount`
//    (32 at c0, 2048 at c3). The corner records are indexed by BIN BLOCK rather
//    than by probe slot, which is both smaller (a cascade has fewer blocks than
//    slots) and exactly the index the merge kernel already has.
//
// 3. **THE CORNER RECORD STORES THE PARENT'S BLOCK, NOT ITS PROBE INDEX.** One
//    more dereference at resolve time, removed from the inner loop — and it
//    keeps `probeTable` out of the merge kernel entirely, which matters because
//    the portable limit is 8 storage buffers per stage and this kernel wants
//    payload + two corner buffers + stats already.
//
// ══ A STALE CORNER RECORD CANNOT BE READ, AND THAT IS AN ARGUMENT ══════════
//
// The corner pass writes records only for blocks a live probe currently holds.
// A block sitting in the free pool keeps whatever it was told last time it was
// claimed, which would be a dangling parent pointer if anything read it. Then
// nothing does: an unclaimed block took no deposits this frame, the deposit's
// clear zeroed its accumulators, and [F] therefore wrote UNKNOWN into every one
// of its bins — so the merge takes its `selfT < 0` early-out before it ever
// looks at the record. The safety comes from the frame order, not from a clear,
// and that is why the order is stated rather than assumed.
