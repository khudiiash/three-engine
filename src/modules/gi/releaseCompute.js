/**
 * Evicts a GI build's compute nodes from the RENDERER's caches.
 *
 * ## Why `#dispose()` was not enough
 *
 * `GISystem#dispose` closes with:
 *
 *     // Compute nodes / storage buffers are released with GC once nothing
 *     // references them; three's storage attributes hold no scene-graph refs.
 *
 * True of the scene graph, false of the renderer. Every dispatched compute node
 * gets an entry in `renderer._pipelines` and `renderer._bindings`, and a BIND
 * GROUP holds strong references to every buffer and texture it binds. So the
 * old build's `bits` allocation (449 MB on Bistro), its occupancy field
 * (360 MB) and its SRC store (142 MB) stay reachable from the renderer after
 * `state.volume.dispose()` has run — `dispose()` frees the objects it knows
 * about and the renderer quietly keeps the memory.
 *
 * The tell is in the boot log: **516 pipelines compiled for 68 kernels**, about
 * 7.6 generations' worth. Every rebuild mints fresh compute nodes and three
 * keys pipelines on node id, so a rebuild is a guaranteed cache miss — the old
 * generation is never evicted, just orphaned in a cache that never shrinks.
 *
 * Measured symptom (user, 2026-08-17): "each time I change gi settings, it
 * rebuilds and memory heap is still climbing, currently having 6GB" — ~2 GB per
 * rebuild, flat while idle. At 13.4 GB the WebGPU device died outright
 * ("Instance dropped in popErrorScope").
 *
 * ## What this does
 *
 * `Bindings.deleteForCompute` destroys the bind groups (the thing actually
 * holding the buffers) and drops the node's cache entry; `Pipelines.delete`
 * drops the compiled pipeline. Both are three's own per-object eviction paths —
 * the same ones it calls when a compute node is disposed through channels GI
 * does not use.
 *
 * ⚠ ONLY EVER CALL THIS ON A NODE THE CALLER IS THROWING AWAY. Evicting a node
 * that is still dispatched costs a full recompile of that kernel — on this
 * project's SRC kernels that is 16-27 seconds, not a hitch.
 *
 * Defensive throughout: these are three's underscore-private caches (the same
 * ones `outputDither.js` already reaches into), so a three upgrade that renames
 * them must degrade to "leaks as before", never to a crash mid-rebuild.
 *
 * @param {any} renderer
 * @param {Iterable<any>} nodes
 * @returns {number} how many nodes were evicted

/**
 * Purges three's MATERIAL node-builder cache.
 *
 * The compute-node eviction above did not stop the heap climbing (measured
 * 2026-08-17: an identical `high` config read 1992 MB on its first build and
 * 6394 MB two rebuilds later, with GPU texture memory returning to exactly
 * 118 MB both times — so the GPU side is clean and this is pure JS heap).
 *
 * The compute kernels were never the bulk. A GI rebuild re-injects GI's nodes
 * into EVERY material, and on this project each material's fragment shader is
 * 180-250 kB of WGSL over a node graph many times that size in JS objects —
 * 116 materials of it. `NodeManager.nodeBuilderCache` is a plain `Map` keyed by
 * a material CACHE KEY, so a rebuild does not overwrite the old entries, it
 * adds new ones beside them under new keys. Nothing prunes them: the per-object
 * `delete()` path only runs for objects three is told about, and a GI rebuild
 * tells it about nothing.
 *
 * `NodeManager.dispose()` is three's own reset for this (`this.nodeBuilderCache
 * = new Map()`), and calling it costs a rebuild of the node states — which is
 * exactly what the GI rebuild that follows is about to do anyway, so the work
 * is not additional, only the eviction is.
 *
 * ⚠ GLOBAL, NOT GI-SCOPED. This drops cached node state for post-processing and
 * every other material too. That is safe (three rebuilds lazily on next use)
 * but it is not free, so it belongs ONLY on a teardown that is already followed
 * by a full recompile. `__giPurgeNodeCache = false` disables it.

/**
 * Drops the JS-side twin of a GPU-only storage buffer.
 *
 * ## The mechanism (verified against three r1xx
 * `WebGPUAttributeUtils.createAttribute`)
 *
 * `instancedArray(new Uint32Array(N))` builds a
 * `StorageInstancedBufferAttribute`. The FIRST time it is bound, three creates
 * the GPU buffer `mappedAtCreation` and does
 * `new array.constructor(buffer.getMappedRange()).set(array)` — one copy, then
 * `buffer.unmap()`. From that moment the JS array is dead weight: nothing reads
 * it again unless the owner writes it CPU-side and bumps `version`
 * (`Attributes.update` → `updateAttribute`, which is the ONLY other reader).
 *
 * On Bistro that dead weight is ~1.1 GB (`bits` alone is 449 MB), and it is
 * pinned for the process's life by the closure that allocated it.
 *
 * ## Why a zero-length view of the same constructor is the safe replacement
 *
 * Everything downstream that touches `.array` after upload reads only its TYPE,
 * never its contents or length:
 *
 *   · `BufferAttribute.count` is fixed at construction (`array.length /
 *     itemSize`) and is what every dispatch-count and binding-size path uses.
 *   · `NodeStorageBuffer.buffer` is a live getter over `nodeUniform.value.array`
 *     — so it follows the swap rather than pinning the old array (a stored
 *     reference would have made this unsafe; `StorageBuffer`'s base class DOES
 *     store one, and the node subclass overriding it is what saves us).
 *   · Bind-group creation reads `backend.get(binding.attribute).buffer` — the
 *     GPU buffer, never the CPU array (`WebGPUBindingUtils.createBindings`).
 *   · `getArrayBufferAsync` sizes its readback from `bufferGPU.size`.
 *   · `createShaderVertexBuffers` reads `array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT`, which lives
 *     on the constructor — preserved by construction here.
 *
 * A DEVICE LOSS does not resurrect the need for the mirror: `renderer-rebuilt`
 * makes GISystem `#dispose()` and rebuild from scratch, so every buffer is
 * re-minted with a fresh array against the new device. Nothing ever re-uploads
 * a detached attribute (three re-creates a GPU buffer only when its
 * `Attributes` entry was deleted, which happens for geometry attributes through
 * `Geometries`' dispose handler and never for a standalone storage buffer).
 *
 * ⚠ NEVER call this on an attribute the owner writes CPU-side later
 * (`addUpdateRange` + `needsUpdate`). `updateAttribute` would then upload zero
 * bytes and the write would silently vanish. In GI that is the KEEP set:
 * `vertexBuffer`, `indexBuffer`, `pairWork`, `localToWorld`, the dynamic-object
 * staging/uploader buffers, and every `uniformArray`.
 *
 * @param {any} renderer
 * @param {any} attr a `StorageInstancedBufferAttribute` (`node.value`)
 * @returns {boolean} true when the mirror is gone (or was already gone); false
 *   when the buffer has not been uploaded yet — the caller retries next tick.
