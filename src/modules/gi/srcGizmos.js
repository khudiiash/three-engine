// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — the probe gizmos.
//
// Plan §7 Phase 1: "debug gizmos (instanced spheres colored by cascade/LOD)",
// and the eye check that closes the phase. This is the instrument for the two
// questions no numeric gate can settle — "are the probes WHERE the geometry
// is" and "do the LOD rings look like rings" — on a real scene, at a real
// camera, in motion.
//
// ══ READ ON THE GPU, NEVER READ BACK ═══════════════════════════════════════
//
// The probe table lives in a storage buffer, and the obvious way to draw it is
// to read it back each frame and write instance matrices. That is 2.5 MB per
// frame at a realistic probe count and it makes the debug view lag the thing it
// is debugging by exactly one readback — which, for a view whose whole job is
// to show membership CHURN, would hide the artifact.
//
// So the vertex stage reads the table directly: one `InstancedMesh` per
// cascade, `positionNode` deriving each probe's world position from its own
// KEY, and a dead probe collapsing to radius zero. Nothing crosses the bus and
// the gizmos are exactly as current as the frame they annotate.
//
// ══ THE STANDING RULE, INHERITED FROM srcDebugViews.js ═════════════════════
//
// A debug view that renders a different field than the traces do lies about the
// thing it exists to show. These spheres are placed by `srcMathTsl`'s OWN
// `keyCell`/`latticeOrigin`/`cellPosition`/`probeSpacing` — the same functions
// `srcProbes.js` inserts with, gated bit-exact against the CPU mirror by
// `test:gi-src-math`. A gizmo that re-derived the lattice would be a second
// definition of where a probe is, and the first thing it would do is disagree
// silently.
//
// `three/webgpu`, not `three`: the node materials only exist on the WebGPU
// entry point, and `new THREE.MeshBasicNodeMaterial()` off the base build
// throws "is not a constructor" at RENDER time, not at import.
