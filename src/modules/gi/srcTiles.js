// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — [H] THE IRRADIANCE TILES.
//
// Per c0 probe, bake the Lambertian rendering-equation integral into a 6×6
// octahedral tile with a 1-texel border, packed into one atlas texture. Pixels
// then take ≤8 FILTERED samples of these tiles in the normal direction, which
// is the entire reason this pass exists: a raw per-pixel gather over 32
// directions × 8 probes is 256 unfiltered reads, and the paper calls that out
// as prohibitive.
//
// ══ WHY ONLY CASCADE 0 ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Because [G] has already happened. A merged c0 bin carries the radiance and
// transmittance of the WHOLE cascade chain above it, so cascade 0 is not "the
// near field" any more — it is the complete answer, at the finest spatial
// resolution the hierarchy has. Baking tiles for cascades 1-3 would bake the
// same light at coarser spacing and nothing would ever read them.
//
// ══ THE NORMALIZATION IS LOAD-BEARING (R4) ═════════════════════════════════
//
//     E(n̂) = π · Σ L_bin·W(bin, n̂) / Σ W(bin, n̂)
//
// NOT `Δω · Σ L·cos`. The two agree in the limit, but the normalized form is
// EXACT for uniform radiance at ANY bin count — feed it L = 1 everywhere and it
// returns exactly π, so ρ/π·E is exactly ρ. That makes the furnace test a
// statement about the ESTIMATOR rather than about discretization error, and it
// is what bounds Phase 5's multibounce loop gain below 1 by construction. It is
// also the same analytic π `srcGather.js` had to be corrected to (§12.17.2,
// where the discrete form invented 1% of the energy).
//
// ══ THE KERNEL HAS NO OCTAHEDRAL MATH IN IT, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN ════════
//
// Two facts collapse into one uploaded table:
//
//   1. `W(bin, n̂)` depends only on (w, interior, sub) — never on the scene — so
//      it is computed once on the CPU by `binCosineWeights`, the SAME function
//      the mirror uses. There is no twin to keep in sync because there is no
//      second implementation.
//   2. A BORDER texel's value is by definition the interior integral at its
//      wrapped texel (`octahedralBorderMap`). So instead of copying values
//      after the fact, the border texel's table row IS its wrapped interior
//      row — and the thread that owns it simply computes that integral.
//
// `tileCosineWeights` folds both into a `[texel · nBins + bin]` array covering
// all 64 texels of the bordered tile. What is left in WGSL is a loop over bins
// multiplying two numbers. No fold, no wrap, no second copy pass, and — the
// part that actually mattered — **no read-after-write on the atlas**, which a
// separate border-copy pass would have needed and which WebGPU does not allow
// for a texture bound writable in the same dispatch.
//
// ══ THE BORDER IS A CORRECTNESS REQUIREMENT, NOT A LAYOUT DETAIL ═══════════
//
// The octahedral square's centre is +Z and all four CORNERS are −Z, so the
// exact −Z direction sits precisely where bilinear filtering has nothing to
// interpolate toward. Without a border, all four taps collapse onto the single
// interior corner texel, whose own direction at 6×6 is 19.4° off axis — a
// systematic, ORIENTATION-DEPENDENT error measured at **+32% on a −Z-facing
// receiver** (§12.2). It is invisible to every test that does not vary surface
// orientation and it does not shrink with probe spacing, ray count or angular
// resolution.
//
// ══ THE TAPS CANNOT LEAVE THEIR OWN TILE, WHICH IS WHY AN ATLAS IS SAFE ════
//
// `sampleTile`'s interior-space coordinate is `(f·0.5 + 0.5)·interior − 0.5 +
// border`, and `f ∈ [−1, 1]`, so it spans `[0.5, interior + 0.5]` — the four
// bilinear taps therefore land in `[0, interior + 1]`, exactly the tile's own
// `interior + 2` texels. No tap can reach a neighbouring tile in the atlas, at
// any normal, for any probe. That is what makes hardware bilinear over a packed
// atlas correct rather than merely cheap, and the gate asserts it directly.
//
// ══ WHAT READS THIS TODAY: NOTHING ═════════════════════════════════════════
//
// [I] (`srcScreenGather.js`) reads them: one filtered tap per trilinear
// corner, in the shading point's normal direction. They were built and gated
// one unit AHEAD of that consumer, which is the same decomposition Phase 1 used
// for the probes: build the thing, prove it against the mirror, then connect it.

      // re-minted — cell-scale blocks that rearrange when the camera moves,

      // degrades as 1/d²). That is the user's report in one line of code.

    // 1 where this texel found at least one known bin, 0 where it found none.
    // The channel was otherwise wasted, and what it buys is R1 implemented in
    // the texture unit: bilinear over RGB gives `Σ w_i·E_i` (empty texels store
    // 0 and contribute nothing) and bilinear over alpha gives `Σ w_i` over the
    // SAME taps, so `rgb / a` is the renormalized average over the taps that
    // had information — exactly `sparseGather`'s rule, for free, at the filter
    // hardware's cost of nothing.
    //
    // NOTHING DIVIDES BY IT YET, deliberately. The RGB written here is
    // bit-for-bit what `bakeProbeIrradiance` produces, so [H] stays a
    // "make the GPU agree with the mirror" unit and the gate can diff it
    // exactly. Whether [I] renormalizes — and whether the mirror's
    // `sampleTile` grows a coverage channel to match — is unit 5's decision,
    // made with the measured empty-texel rate in hand rather than in advance.
    // ⛔⛔ E IS PREMULTIPLIED BY COVER, AND IT MUST BE (§12.87b, 2026-08-24).
    //
    // `srcScreenGather.js:422-424` accumulates `acc += tap.xyz·weight` and
    // `wsum += tap.w·weight`, then divides ONCE at `:439`. That computes
    // `Σ w·c·E / Σ w·c` — a coverage-weighted mean — ONLY if the stored rgb
    // already carries `c`. Storing bare `E` computes `Σ w·E / Σ w·c` instead,
    // which is the mean divided by mean coverage: a gain of 1/c̄.
    //
    // With the shipped flag (`cover ≡ 1`) the two are identical, which is why
    // this survived — and it is why this line is a PROVABLE NO-OP on the
    // default path. Under `__giTileCoverFraction = true` it was not: c̄ runs
    // 0.378 (+Z face) to 0.689 (floor+wall junction), i.e. a **1.45×-2.65×
    // brightening that varies with each probe's feeding orientation** — per
    // 0.45 m cell. The opt-in arm as first written would have MANUFACTURED
    // exactly the cell-scale blocks it was built to test a cure for.
    //
    // ⚠ The CPU mirror was right all along (`srcRef.js` gatherPixel:
    // `const w = weight * cov; acc.r += c[0]*w; acc.w += w`), so the two twins
    // implemented different estimators under the hatch and only the GPU was
    // wrong. `test:gi-src-gather` cannot see it while the flag is off.
