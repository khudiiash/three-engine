// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — the GISystem entry point.
//
// Plan §7: "GISystem grows one `backend === "split-rc"` branch that early-outs
// into `srcSystem`, not tentacles." This is that early-out. Everything SRC
// needs from the engine arrives through the four arguments below; everything
// GISystem needs from SRC is on the returned object. Neither knows anything
// else about the other, which is the only reason the Phase-2/3 work can grow
// underneath this without turning into a sweep through a 7,000-line file.
//
// ══ ON BY DEFAULT SINCE PHASE 5 LANDED (user decision, 2026-08-11) ═════════
//
// `__giSrcProbes` defaulted OFF through Phases 1–4 because the population
// produced no light — the transport deposited zeros, so on-by-default would
// have cost GPU time for nothing and made every §12 number incomparable. That
// rationale died with Phase 5: hit shading is landed and wired (§12.28–§12.29),
// SRC is the ONLY diffuse-indirect term this module has (§12.8 deleted the
// dense cascades), so off-by-default meant every project shipped with no bounce
// unless someone typed a console flag before boot.
//
// `__giSrcProbes = false` is the EXPLICIT opt-out (R12: the hatch is a flag,
// not a rebuild) — it is what a harness pins to measure the legacy-only screen
// chain, and any comparison against numbers recorded before this flip must pin
// it. `smoke:gi-gpu`'s non-src arms and the emitter-shadow probe do exactly
// that.
//
// ══ THE ANCHOR, WHICH IS THE ONE THING HERE THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS ════════════
//
// Probe keys carry cell coordinates in 9 bits per axis, RELATIVE to a lattice
// anchor. At LOD 0 that window is ±256·s₀ — about ±128 m at the default s₀ —
// so an anchor pinned at the world origin makes every near-camera probe
// unrepresentable the moment the player walks 130 m away. `packProbeKey`
// returns EMPTY there, which is correct and silent: GI simply stops having
// probes, and the symptom is a scene that lights fine at spawn and goes flat
// after a walk.
//
// So the anchor follows the camera — but NOT per frame. Re-anchoring re-keys
// every probe, which retires every probe, which is precisely the binary
// per-frame flip R1 forbids. It happens when the camera has drifted past
// `REANCHOR_CHEBYSHEV` (64·s₀, comfortably inside the 254·s₀ the window
// actually allows) and not before.
//
// One property makes this cheap, and it is worth stating because it is not
// obvious from the code: `latticeOrigin(anchor, s) = round(anchor/s)·s` is
// ALWAYS a multiple of s, so every lattice is world-aligned regardless of where
// the anchor sits. **Re-anchoring never moves a probe.** It only renumbers it.
// The cost is a lost temporal history, not a spatial pop.
//

/**
 * Camera drift, in units of s₀, that triggers a re-anchor — DERIVED from the
 * key window, not chosen.
 *
 * ⭐⭐ THE OLD VALUE WAS 64 AND IT FIRED INSIDE THE USER'S HOUSE. The header
 * above called 64 "comfortably inside the 254·s₀ the window actually allows",
 * which is true and was never the question: 64·s₀ at ultra (s₀ = 0.35) is
 * **22.4 m**, and their Level is **27.6 m** long. Their console, mid-play,
 * 2026-08-24:
 *
 *     00:40:20  [gi] src probes: re-anchored (#2) — every probe re-keys, which retires it
 *     00:40:39  [gi] src probes: re-anchored (#3) — every probe re-keys, which retires it
 *
 * Nineteen seconds apart. A re-anchor RETIRES EVERY PROBE IN THE SCENE, so the
 * whole field goes cold and re-converges from nothing — twice, while walking
 * the length of one house. That is the user's report word for word ("still mud
 * everywhere as I move"), and it is a WHOLE-FIELD reset, not a local artifact.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT HID BEHIND A TIER. At `high` (s₀ = 0.45) the radius is 28.8 m, just
 * past the 27.6 m scene, so it never fires — which is why every headless probe
 * run at QUALITY=high measured a scene that never re-anchors, and why the note
 * in this project's memory read "cannot fire indoors". The user runs ULTRA. A
 * threshold that lands on one side of the scene at one tier and the other side
 * at the next tier is not a threshold, it is a coin flip.
 *
 * THE DERIVATION. Probe cells are packed as 9-bit signed offsets from the
 * anchor (`KEY_AXIS_RANGE` 512, `KEY_AXIS_OFFSET` 256 in srcMath), so an offset
 * must stay inside ±254 cells to be representable at all — past it
 * `packProbeKey` returns EMPTY and the probe silently does not exist. Probes
 * are placed around the CAMERA and LOD 0 reaches `lod0Reach()` cells past it,
 * so the furthest live cell sits at `drift + reach` from the anchor:
 *
 *     drift + reach ≤ 254        →  drift ≤ 254 − reach
 *
 * minus one `ANCHOR_QUANTUM` for the frame in which the threshold is crossed.
 * At the shipped reach of 64 that is **174 cells** — 60.9 m at ultra, 78.3 m at
 * high, 139 m at low. Every one of those is past any interior, so the re-anchor
 * goes back to being what the header says it is: the thing that saves a player
 * who walks 130 m away, and nothing that happens indoors at any tier.
 *
 * ⚠ It is computed from `lod0Reach()` rather than the constant because §12.90
 * can scale the reach; a bigger reach must SHRINK this, and hard-coding 174
 * would let the two drift apart silently.

 * (`if (gather && !screenGather)`, giScreen.js) because since [I] the two are

 * So turning probes on REPLACES the working diffuse term with SRC's — and
 * before Phase 5, SRC's carried sky only. The renderer is behaving perfectly
 * and the screen is black.

      // OFF: a 3.8× deposit swing, the "gpu time constantly ballooning"
      // report), but the two effects were bundled onto one signal, so the
      // CHEAP half went with the expensive one. The consequence is the user's
      // 2026-08-15 report — "any light that moves, temporal is just too slow
      // to keep up, it feels very unresponsive": with the window shut, α is
      // spread over a whole refresh interval by the stride root, so at stride
      // ~9 and 30 fps a moving light's field settles with t90 ≈ 7 s.
