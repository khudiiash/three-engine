// CONSERVATIVE OCCUPANCY PYRAMID + HIERARCHICAL DDA — the tracing backend that
// replaces the composited mesh-SDF as the thing GI rays intersect.
// Implements docs/rc-gi-implementation-spec.md phases 1 and 4.
//
// ══ WHY, AND WHY THIS SHAPE RATHER THAN THE SPEC'S ══════════════════════════
//
// THE MEASUREMENT (scripts/run-gi-sdf-coverage.mjs, on the user's real scene):
// the per-mesh SDF bakes are fine — median 12 cells across the thinnest
// dimension. What everything actually traces is the COMPOSITED field, 128³
// over a 42m volume = 0.33m cells. A 0.5m Sponza column is one and a half
// cells wide there, so the field cannot keep its two faces apart and light
// walks through it. Every previous attempt (finer dense field, sparse fp16
// bricks) RESAMPLED that same source, and upsampling a blurred function
// recovers nothing. The only fix is to stop resampling and go to the
// triangles — which is exactly what the spec says.
//
// TWO DELIBERATE DEVIATIONS FROM THE SPEC, both because occupancy is ONE BIT:
//
//  * NO SPARSE BRICKMAP, NO CAMERA-FOLLOWING CLIPMAP (spec §1.1). Those exist
//    to bound memory at 0.125m. A field CELL in this module costs 104 B (six
//    rgba32f storage buffers) — that is what made dense impossible. A voxel
//    here costs 1 BIT. The user's 42.3×18.9×26.1m volume at 0.125m is
//    352×160×224 = 12.6M voxels = 1.6 MB, and the whole 5-level pyramid is
//    1.8 MB. There is no memory problem to solve, so there is no brick table,
//    no pool, no allocator, and no second coordinate system fighting the
//    existing scene-fit / auto-fit-refit volume.
//  * NO EXACT EDT (spec §2). Its only job is empty-space skipping, and the
//    pyramid already does that EXACTLY and conservatively by construction:
//    an OR-downsampled parent is empty only if all 8 children are, so skipping
//    its full extent can never skip geometry. That is strictly stronger than a
//    distance bound (no SAFETY subtraction, no overestimate risk — the spec's
//    whole objection to JFA) and costs 0 bytes on top of the pyramid.
//
// EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE SPEC AS WRITTEN — and its hard rules are kept:
//   · Conservative voxelization is the Akenine-Möller SEPARATING AXIS TEST
//     (13 axes) against the voxel AABB, not a point sample and not a
//     centre-distance test. Every voxel a triangle touches is set.
//   · HITS COME ONLY FROM OCCUPANCY BITS. There is no `sdf < epsilon`
//     anywhere in this file. The pyramid decides where to *look*; a level-0
//     bit decides whether a ray *stopped*.
//
// ══ LAYOUT ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
//   level 0   352×160×224   0.125m   ← the hit test
//   level 1   176× 80×112   0.25m    ┐
//   level 2    88× 40× 56   0.5m     │ OR-downsampled: empty ⇒ all children
//   level 3    44× 20× 28   1.0m     │ empty ⇒ safe to skip the whole extent
//   level 4    22× 10× 14   2.0m     ┘
//
// Bits pack 32-per-u32 ALONG X, so a downsample thread reads 8 contiguous
// child words and folds them with a branchless even-bit compaction. Level-0
// resolution is rounded up to a multiple of 16 so every level halves exactly.
//
// ══ ONE BUFFER, NOT FIVE ════════════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// All five levels live in ONE storage buffer at JS-computed word offsets. The
// shadow trace runs in FRAGMENT shaders on every GI-lit material, where storage
// buffers are the scarce per-stage resource (the ReSTIR 8-buffer note). Five
// bindings for a 1.8 MB pyramid would have been a real cost.
//
// And there are TWO buffers, not one: the voxelizer needs `atomic<u32>`, but
// WGSL only permits atomic access through the atomic intrinsics, and a
// read_write storage binding in a fragment shader is a portability question
// this module does not need to answer. So voxelization writes an atomic
// level-0 scratch and a copy pass lands it in the plain pyramid everything
// else reads. 1.6 MB for zero risk.

 * ## Why this is a separate function
 *
 * It used to be forty lines in the middle of `createOccupancyField`, which
 * allocates GPU storage and cannot run in a test. That is exactly how the bug
 * below survived: the arithmetic had no way to be asserted on, so a constant
 * collision that silently disabled a tuned ratio went unnoticed through the
 * sessions that tuned it.
 *
 * ## ⛔ THE BUG: the ratio was decorative on every large volume
 *
 * `complexTriangleCapacity` and `surfaceCapacity` were clamped by the SAME
 * `1 << 21`. `surfaceCapacity` is itself capped there, so the moment a scene
 * reached the record ceiling, `2097152 * 1.5 = 3145728` was clamped straight
 * back down to `2097152` — **the triangle pool could never be larger than the
 * record pool**, and `COMPLEX_TRIANGLES_PER_RECORD` stopped meaning anything at
 * precisely the scenes it was tuned for.
 *
 * Measured on Bistro (2026-08-17), GI ultra, a 47 m volume over a 109 × 115 m
 * city: `surface records: 1985690/2097152 claimed, triangles 4173329/2097152` —
 * the record pool at 95 % and the triangle pool asking for **199 % of a capacity
 * it was structurally forbidden from having**. 289 858 cells fell back to
 * voxel-box hits, and because GI's detail box follows the camera, WHICH cells
 * lose their triangles changes as you fly. The user's report was *"black patches
 * ... that start filling with light, or turning black again as I move the camera
 * around"* — a pool-sizing arithmetic error, presenting as a lighting bug.
 *
 * The triangle ceiling is now DERIVED from the ratio rather than colliding with
 * it, so the constant is the only thing deciding the relationship.

  // box at ultra's 0.1 m voxels rasterizes to **33,792 of 262,144 level-0
  // voxels = 12.9%**, against a /12 = 8.3% pool. MEASURED, 2026-08-13, on the
  // generated Cornell project through `probe:gi-attribution`:
  //
  //   tier    pool before   occupied level-0   unattributedRate
  //   ultra        21,846             33,792              75.3%

  //   medium       16,384             18,370              25.9%
  //
  // (high and medium sit on the `1 << 14` FLOOR, not on /12 — their grids are
  // small enough that the floor was already the binding constraint, and it is
  // still 15% short of a 5 m room's shell.)
  //
  // The stamps saturate at the pool ceiling (21,833 of 21,846 at ultra), every
  // stamped record resolves to a live palette entry, and three quarters of the
  // frame's static hits still shade at the palette MEAN albedo — the "weird
  // lighting" report, and it was misfiled as a tier-SWITCH staleness because
  // the healthy 3% it was compared against came from a different scene. Nothing
  // goes stale; the pool is simply short, and it is short on a FRESH boot too.
  //
  // SO THE POOL GETS AS MUCH OF THE GRID AS A FIXED BYTE BUDGET ALLOWS, and
  // never less than the /12 baseline. Records cost
  // `(SURFACE_RECORD_WORDS + SURFACE_SCRATCH_WORDS) × 4 = 56 B`, so on a small
  // grid a pool that covers a THIRD of the volume is a few MB — while on a big
  // one the budget is exhausted long before /12 is reached and the number is
  // exactly today's, byte for byte. The crossover sits near 1.8M level-0
  // voxels: Cornell-ultra (262k) is raised 21,846 → 87,382 (+3.7 MB),
  // Sponza-ultra (22.5M) is UNCHANGED at 1,880,064 — which also keeps §13.18's
  // byte-identical deposit WGSL on the scene that gate was measured on.
  //
  // /3 is the ceiling because a surface field that wants more than a third of
  // its own grid is not a surface field, and raising the budget would be the
  // honest remedy there rather than uncapping this.
  //
  // RESULT, same probe, same scene — and it is a PARTIAL fix, stated as one:
  //
  //   tier      before   after   pool after
  //   ultra      75.3%   43.9%   33,792/87,382, 0 bricks denied

  //   medium     25.9%    8.6%   18,370/36,864, 0 bricks denied
  //
  // Every brick now gets its records (`0 bricks DENIED`, and the stamp count

  // Off, this allocates zero words and emits no extra WGSL.
  //
  // KEYED ON THE SURFACE RECORD, NOT ON A COARSE CELL — that is the whole
  // design and it is what makes the number affordable. §12.9's epitaph (below,

  // ══ REGION BASES ARE QUANTIZED, AND IT IS A STARTUP FIX (§13.18) ══════════
  //
  // Every base below is a JS number added into the graph, so it CONSTANT-FOLDS
  // into the WGSL: `bits.element(uint(attrWordOffset).add(...))` emits a
  // literal. Two consequences, and the second is the expensive one:
  //
  //  1. R11 ("grid/world params in uniforms, never baked; a refit must not
  //     recompile") is violated by construction.
  //  2. **A shader whose TEXT changes between boots can never hit a
  //     content-keyed disk cache.** Chrome keys compiled shaders on WGSL
  //     source, and the measurement is not subtle: the SAME deposit kernel
  //     compiled against the SAME browser profile reads 3,665 ms on the first
  //     process and **18 ms / 22 ms on the next two — ~200×** (§13.18's
  //     `PROFILE=<dir>` arm of `probe:wgsl-compile`). The cache serves this
  //     kernel perfectly. It simply never gets the chance, because two cold
  //     boots of IDENTICAL code produced WGSL differing in exactly three baked
  //     offsets (delta 3024 words).
  //
  // The regions above this line are sized from `res0` and are already stable.
  // The ones below are not: `staticBvhWords` comes from a BVH build and
  // `dynamicObjectWords` from whichever movers were adopted, so both wobble
  // run to run — and EVERY base after them wobbles with them, including the
  // attribution/palette pair the SRC deposit reads.
  //
  // So each base is rounded up to `LAYOUT_GRANULE`. A wobble smaller than the
  // granule now moves NOTHING, the offsets stay literal (no uniform, no lost
  // constant folding, no shader-speed trade — which is why this beats
  // uniformizing them), and the cost is at most one granule of padding per
  // region: ~1 MB against a 157 MB allocation.
  //
  // ⚠ This makes the text stable, NOT constant: a real change (different
  // scene, a region crossing a granule) still shifts the layout and still
  // recompiles, correctly. ⚠ And it is only worth anything if EVERY varying
  // base is covered — one survivor keeps the text unstable and buys nothing,

  // ─────────────────────────────────────────── COARSE-CELL SURFACE ATTRIBUTES
  //
  // WHY THIS EXISTS: to delete the mesh-SDF atlas. The composite does not use
  // the per-mesh SDFs for their DISTANCE alone — it uses them to answer "which
  // slot owns this cell" (so it can read that slot's mean albedo/emissive) and
  // "which way does the surface face". Those two answers are the atlas's real
  // job in the lighting path, and this pass produces both without a bake:
  // the voxelizer already visits every (slot, triangle, voxel), so it knows the
  // owning slot and the exact face normal at the moment it sets a bit.
  //
  // AT THE COARSE CELL RESOLUTION, not level-0. The composite is per coarse
  // cell, and per-level-0 attributes would cost more than the atlas they
  // replace (12.6M voxels × 8 B = 100 MB). A coarse grid is a few MB.
  //
  // LAST WRITE WINS, deliberately, with no atomics. Several triangles land in
  // one coarse cell and any of them is a correct answer: albedo/emissive are
  // per-slot MEAN colours (the atlas's own approximation, unchanged), and the
  // normal only has to be representative — the cascades sample it to orient a
  // cell's radiance, not to shade a silhouette. Racing stores cost nothing and
  // an atomic would serialise the hot loop of the whole voxelizer.
  //
  // THE COARSE SURFACE-ATTRIBUTION GRID IS GONE (SRC rebuild §12.9). `cellAttr`
  // held "atlas slot + 1" per COMPOSITE cell — an atomic u32 the voxelizer
  // stamped with atomicMax so a cell shared by several meshes picked a
  // deterministic winner, plus `staticAttr` to snapshot it across the
  // static/dynamic split, plus a `slotAtlas` uniform array bridging the
  // pyramid's slot numbering to the atlas's. Its only consumer was the
  // composite pass, which read it to give a cell a surface colour.
  //
  // Two things went with it and are worth naming, because both were paid for:
  // the crossed-numbering bug (two independent slot numberings fed the
  // composite a different mesh's colour, and the remap was applied in the
  // VOXELIZER rather than read in the composite because that kernel already sat
  // at the user GPU's 12-uniform-buffer per-stage limit, where buffer 13 fails
  // CreateBindGroupLayout and drops the whole compute batch); and the
  // deterministic-winner fix (last-write-wins re-rolled every seam cell's
  // colour per dispatch, which the bounce amplified into visible flicker).
  // Anything that re-introduces per-cell surface attribution inherits both.
  //
  // ── ITS SUCCESSOR, AND HOW IT ANSWERS BOTH (SRC Phase 5, plan §12.29) ─────
  //
  // `enableSurfaceAttribution` re-introduces exactly this, and had to answer
  // the two bugs above before a line of it was written:
  //
  //   · CROSSED NUMBERING — killed by DELETION, not by a remap. The stamp is
  //     the OCCUPANCY slot (`pairSlot`, the number the voxelizer already holds)
  //     and the palette is indexed by that same number, built from
  //     `field.placements`. `SlotRegistry`'s free-stack numbering — a genuinely
  //     different number, still, `GISystem:6270` vs `SlotRegistry:98` — is
  //     bridged by KEY (`slotKeyOf(mesh, instanceId)`) and never by index, so
  //     there is one numbering on the GPU and nothing to get backwards.
  //   · DETERMINISTIC WINNER — `atomicMax` on the stamp, the same fix as
  //     before. A cell shared by several meshes picks the highest occupancy
  //     slot, every dispatch, whatever order the threads arrive in.
  //
  // The resolution objection is answered by moving the KEY rather than by
  // accepting the coarse cell: per surface RECORD, which is level-0 precision
  // at surface-manifold cost. See the sizing block at `attributionEnabled`.

  // -accumulate kernel bound, and the portable WebGPU limit is EIGHT. On a
  // phone (and on any adapter that advertises only the baseline)
  // `occupancy#7`'s pipeline layout is then invalid, every bind group built
  // from it fails, the occupancy chain never runs, and GI ships a scene with
  // NO transport at all — the user's "on mobile only emissive lighting works,
  // the sun's indirect light is missing entirely". Emissives survive because

  /**
   * Phase-2/3 traversal (HybridPlane / HybridPlaneCoverage): the Phase-1
   * macrocell + brick DDA, but an occupied voxel holding a usable SIMPLE
   * record resolves through a bounded ray-plane intersection — optionally
   * clipped by the Phase-3 4x4 coverage mask — and a REJECTED plane lets the
   * ray keep marching. That continuation is the accuracy improvement over
   * occupied-box hits (a grazing ray no longer stops at a voxel face the
   * surface never crosses). Any cell without a usable record — complex fit,
   * pool overflow, not yet fitted — keeps the exact legacy occupied-box
   * semantics, so classification can tighten accuracy but can never widen a
   * leak beyond the bounded plane acceptance itself. DynamicBrick cells read
   * the per-chain DYNAMIC record tail (refit at the mover's current pose
   * every dispatch), falling back to the same box semantics wherever the
   * tail has no usable record.
   *
   * `opts.exact` (Phase 4, HybridExactComplex) adds one more branch, between
   * the plane test and that box fallback: a cell marked COMPLEX carries its
   * whole (≤ MAX_COMPLEX_TRIANGLES) triangle list in the pool, so the ray runs
   * a bounded Möller-Trumbore sweep over it and a genuinely empty result lets
   * the DDA continue. It is the ONE case where a cell can be left without a
   * hit on exact evidence rather than conservative evidence.
   *
   * The packed return differs from Phase-1: zw carry the OCT-ENCODED
   * voxel-space hit normal (a fitted plane's normal no longer fits the axis
   * convention). The wrapper decodes and maps it to world space with the
   * covariant transform for the diagonal voxel scale (n_world ∝ n_vox ·
   * voxelInv), which leaves axis-aligned face normals untouched.

   *
   * ══ WHY THE CONTINUITY IS THE WHOLE FEATURE ════════════════════════════
   *
   * §15 U3/U3b weight a probe's contribution by whether the probe can SEE the
   * point, marching this field between them. Built on the binary reader that
   * weight is a step function of position: as a shaded pixel slides along a
   * flat wall, each march sample crosses voxel boundaries and the corner's
   * weight FLIPS. The lit/unlit boundary that comes out is stair-stepped at
   * voxel granularity — which is exactly why U3 was shipped, seen by the user
   * ("stair-stepped light boundaries on walls"), and reverted to opt-in the
   * same night. The leak it removed was real; the staircase it drew was worse.
   *
   * Trilinear filtering makes the same test vary smoothly over one voxel, so
   * the boundary becomes a soft gradient rather than a lattice of squares, and
   * the suppression can ship. It is the "fractional occupancy / filtered read"
   * the revert named as the re-flip precondition.
   *
   * ⚠ THE HALF-VOXEL SHIFT IS NOT COSMETIC. `occupiedAtWorld` floors a
   * voxel-space position to get a CELL INDEX; interpolating between cells
   * means interpolating between their CENTRES, so the lattice has to be
   * shifted by half a voxel first. Without the shift the filter is centred on
   * cell corners, which biases every reading half a voxel toward −xyz — on a
   * 0.22 m grid that is 11 cm of systematic error in a test whose entire job
   * is to decide which side of a 0.25 m wall a probe is on.
   *
   * Cost: eight bit fetches per call against the binary reader's one, all
   * against `occupiedAtLevel0` (constant-folded dimensions, no `levelSelect`
   * chain). Priced in the U3 gate rather than assumed.

  /**
   * THE PYRAMID AS A DISTANCE ORACLE — a conservative lower bound on the
   * distance from world point `p` to the nearest occupied geometry.
   *
   * This is what lets the mesh-SDF atlas be deleted. Soft shadows need a
   * CONTINUOUS distance (the penumbra estimator is `min(k·d/t)`), and a bitset
   * appears to have none — which is why the 40 MB per-mesh atlas survived every
   * other round of SDF removal. But the pyramid already carries one for free:
   * a level-L voxel is `2^L` voxels wide and an OR-downsampled parent is empty
   * only if ALL its children are, so an empty level-L neighbourhood is a proof
   * of emptiness over its whole extent.
   *
   * Concretely, per level: take the 2×2×2 block of level-L voxels nearest `p`
   * (the 8 whose corners bracket it). If every one is empty, nothing occupied
   * lies inside a box that extends at least half a level-L voxel from `p` in
   * every direction, so the true distance is at least `p`'s distance to that
   * box's boundary. The coarsest level that passes gives the largest bound.
   *
   * IT IS CONTINUOUS, which is the property that matters and the one a naive
   * bitset lookup lacks: the returned value is a distance to a BOX FACE, so it
   * varies smoothly as `p` moves, rather than snapping between powers of two.
   * The bound itself is a step function of the level, but the value within a
   * level is not, and the penumbra estimator only ever sees the value.
   *
   * PURE DATAFLOW, no `If` around the fetches, no early exit — the idiom that
   * rendered the BVH mirror pass black (see `occupiedAt`'s note). Occupancy is
   * monotone across levels (coarse-empty implies fine-empty), so `max` over all
   * levels is exactly "the coarsest level that passed" anyway.
   *
   * @param {*} p world position
   * @param {number} maxLevel highest pyramid level to consult. Each level costs
   *   8 buffer reads, and the bound saturates at `2^maxLevel · voxel`, so a
   *   caller that only needs to sharpen a coarse distance near surfaces (the
   *   traces) passes a small number and lets its existing far-field distance
   *   cover the rest. The composite, which HAS no other source, passes them all.

    // THE MISTAKE THIS REPLACES, because it is an easy one to make again: the
    // first version used the same 2×2×2 all-empty test at level 0 as at every
    // other level, so it returned **0** for any point within a voxel of
    // geometry (a block counts as occupied if ANY of its 8 voxels is). Sphere
    // tracing on that inflates every occluder by a voxel — it sealed the leak
    // beautifully and made the whole scene visibly darker, which is exactly
    // what was reported.
    //
    // The fix is to measure instead of test. For each occupied voxel in the
    // 3×3×3 neighbourhood, the distance from `p` to that voxel's AABB is a
    // conservative lower bound on the distance to whatever triangle set the
    // bit (the triangle is somewhere inside the box, so it can only be
    // farther). Geometry OUTSIDE the neighbourhood is at least as far as the
    // block's boundary. So the smaller of those two is a valid bound, and —
    // unlike a block flag — it varies smoothly from 0 at the surface.

   * WHY: the field's injection was BINARY per cell — a 5%-covered edge voxel

   * light lurched in whole field-cell quanta (and every past-MAX_EMITTERS
