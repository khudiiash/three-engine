// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — static surface attribution. The GPU path from a
// ray hit to the material it landed on.
//
//     surfaceAt(voxel, worldPos, normal) → { albedo, emissive, emitter, valid }
//
// `srcShade.js` calls this once per shaded hit and asks nothing else about
// provenance: movers read the same shape out of `moverSurfaceAt`, statics read
// it here, and the hit shader never learns which it got. Plan §4.4, §12.26.10
// item 3 — the one item on that handoff list that is not a shader change.
//
// ══ WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, AND WHAT IT REPLACES ════════════════════════════
//
// The dense backend answered "what colour is this hit" by sampling the radiance
// field at the hit point, and the field carried a per-cell surface colour that
// a COARSE ATTRIBUTION GRID (`cellAttr`/`staticAttr`/`slotAtlas`) had written at
// voxelize time. §12.9 deleted all of it with the field. SRC has probes rather
// than a field, so nothing was left: `SURFACE_MATERIAL_ID_WORD` had long since
// been repurposed as the complex-cell triangle range (`packComplexRange`), and
// `occupancyField.js` exposed no `surfaceAt`. A static hit had no path to its
// material at all, and `srcShade.js` shaded every one of them grey.
//
// ══ THE THREE DECISIONS, AND WHAT EACH ONE COSTS ════════════════════════════
//
// **1. KEYED ON THE SURFACE RECORD, NOT ON A CELL.** The epitaph in
// `occupancyField.js` records why the deleted grid was COARSE: per-level-0
// attributes cost 12.6M voxels × 8 B = 100 MB, so it settled for the composite
// cell and accepted that a 0.5 m cell shared by a column and a floor gets one
// colour. Records dodge the trade entirely — they already exist per OCCUPIED
// level-0 voxel, so one u32 per record is level-0 precision at
// surface-manifold cost. It is also the resolution the intersection was
// computed at, which is R2 applied to attribution rather than to a bias.
//
// **AND IT INHERITS THAT POOL'S CEILING, WHICH IS A REAL FAILURE MODE.** A
// brick whose record claim the voxelizer denied has no records, therefore no
// stamps, therefore every hit inside it comes back unattributed — so
// `unattributedRate` reports on `surfaceRecordCapacity` as much as on this
// file. Measured 2026-08-13: the generated Cornell room at ultra had 33,792
// occupied level-0 voxels against a pool of 21,846 records and read **75.3%
// unattributed ON A FRESH BOOT**. That was misfiled for a session as a
// tier-SWITCH staleness, because the healthy 3% it was compared against came
// from a DIFFERENT SCENE (Sponza, whose pool is at 66% and reads 0.00%) — a
// switch only moves this number because the tier moves the voxel size.
// `occupancyField.js`'s `surfaceRecordDemand` carries the table and the sizing
// fix (75.3% → 43.9% at ultra; the pool is no longer a cause, and **the
// residual is OPEN**); `probe:gi-attribution` is the instrument. When this rate
// is high, read `[gi] surface records: … POOL STARVED` before suspecting the
// palette — and check `stamp&live == stamps` before suspecting either.
//
// **2. IT RIDES THE `bits` BUFFER.** Both the stamp and the palette are tail
// regions of the occupancy allocation, so a consumer that already traces reads
// them through a binding it already holds: **zero new storage buffers and zero
// new uniform buffers on the deposit kernel** (R7). That is not tidiness. The
// deposit binds the pyramid, the probe table, the bins and the per-pixel
// buffers against a portable limit of eight, and §12.9 records that the LAST
// attribution grid had its slot remap applied in the voxelizer rather than read
// in the consumer *because that kernel had run out of uniform slots*. A design
// that needs a binding here does not get to be correct later.
//
// **3. THE STAMP IS A SLOT ID, THE COLOUR IS A PALETTE.** The deleted grid held
// colours, so the only way to change one was to re-run the voxelizer that wrote
// it — a material recolour re-rasterized the scene. Here the stamp is an
// occupancy slot and colour lives in a 512-entry palette, so a recolour is a
// uniform write plus a 512-thread dispatch. `SlotRegistry` grew a separate
// `surfaceRevision` for exactly this; `revision` (the re-voxelize signal) no
// longer moves for a colour.
//
// ══ THE TWO BUGS §12.9 PAID FOR, ANSWERED ═══════════════════════════════════
//
// **CROSSED NUMBERING** — two independent slot numberings fed the composite a
// different mesh's colour. Both numberings are still live today:
// `GISystem#occupancyContentOf` hands out occupancy slots from a stable
// monotonic map (`GISystem.js:6270`) while `SlotRegistry.allocateSlot` pops a
// free stack (`slotRegistry.js:98`), and they are different numbers for the
// same mesh. So the remap is not fixed here, it is DELETED: the GPU sees one
// numbering (the occupancy slot, which is what the voxelizer stamps and what
// indexes the palette), and the registry is reached by KEY —
// `slotKeyOf(mesh, instanceId)` — never by index. There is nothing left to get
// backwards. `crossNumbering` in the options is the deliberate-failure arm that
// proves the gate can see it.
//
// **THE DETERMINISTIC WINNER** — last-write-wins re-rolled every seam cell's
// colour per dispatch and the bounce amplified it into visible flicker. The
// stamp is written with `atomicMax`, so a level-0 voxel shared by several
// meshes picks the highest occupancy slot every dispatch, whatever order the
// threads arrive in. Bit-identical across reruns is a gate arm, not a claim.
//
// ══ WHAT AN UNATTRIBUTED HIT RETURNS, AND WHY IT IS NOT BLACK ═══════════════
//
// R1: a cell with no attribution must not be a hard cliff, and silent black is
// the failure mode this whole rebuild keeps re-finding. Three things produce
// one — a hit whose voxel has no surface record (a macro cell that is not a
// brick, a brick the record pool could not seat), a record no triangle stamped,
// and an occupancy placement whose mesh never seated an atlas slot. All three
// return the palette's MEAN albedo with zero emission and `emitter = -1`, and
// all three set `valid = 0`. The mean keeps the bounce's MAGNITUDE right and
// loses only its hue; black would remove the energy and look like geometry.
// `valid` is what makes it countable — `srcShade.js` feeds it to
// `STAT_UNATTRIBUTED`, which is the only number that says how much of a frame
// this is.
//
// ══ THE EMITTER FLAG, AND WHY IT DOES NOT DO THE ZEROING ════════════════════
//
// `emitter` is the index into the NEE emitter set when the hit surface IS one
// of the sampled lights, and −1 otherwise. R5 says one representation per light
// per path: an emitter both sampled by NEE and emissive on contact delivers its
// energy twice, measured in the mirror at **2.60×** on mean floor irradiance
// (§12.26.7) and invisible to any check that does not compare the two paths.
//
// **BUT THE ZEROING ALREADY HAPPENS, ON THE CPU, AND IT STAYS THERE.**
// `GISystem.#slotSurface` publishes zero emissive for a promoted entry, and
// `dynamicObjects.writeSurface` does the same for movers (`:1168`) — the latter
// with a comment recording the exact double-count bug it was written for. The
// promotion set IS the NEE set, so the bake already zeroes precisely what the
// sampler delivers. Shipping raw emissive here and zeroing on the GPU would put
// R5 in a THIRD place and make the flag and the promotion set two sources of
// truth for one fact, which is the crossed-numbering shape again. So this
// palette carries `#slotSurface`'s output verbatim, and `emitter` is a flag the
// consumer can ASSERT against rather than a mechanism it depends on.
//
// What that leaves is a failure mode with no counter: a surface whose material
// emits, whose palette emissive is zero, and whose emitter id is −1 — light
// deleted from BOTH paths. That one is invisible to a GPU counter precisely
// because nothing carries emission to notice, so it is checked here on the CPU
// and reported as `stats.emissiveOrphans`. Zero is the healthy reading.
//
// ══ THE ONE PRECISION HAZARD, NAMED ═════════════════════════════════════════
//
// `createSrcSceneTrace` hands over `voxel` rather than letting a consumer
// re-derive it, because the returned `position` is lifted half a coarse cell
// and floors to the SHELL cell. That fixes the lift, not the face:
// `voxelAtHit` is `floor(q0 + dq·t)` and a hit landing exactly ON a cell face
// floors either side of it. The marcher's own record index would settle it, but
// `traceHybridPlane`'s inner `sharedFn` returns a `vec4` with all four
// components spoken for (hit, t, oct.x, oct.y), so surfacing it is a return-type
// change to the most-measured code in the module rather than the one line it
// looks like.
//
// So instead: ask at `voxel` first — the marcher's own answer, right for every
// hit strictly inside its cell — and when that has no stamp, ask once more a
// quarter voxel along −n, which is inside the surface cell whichever side the
// floor fell. Not a heuristic and not a search: the hit is ON the surface and
// the normal points out of it. Both outcomes are counted (`retried`), so the
// rate is a measurement rather than an assumption.
//
// ⚠ A QUARTER OF **WHICH** VOXEL. The step is taken in the ATTRIBUTION GRID's
// own units, and it used to be taken in the VOLUME's: `world.minCell` is the
// coarse SRC lattice cell, which has no fixed relationship to the occupancy
// level-0 voxel this lookup indexes. On Sponza-ultra the two are 0.33 m and
// 0.10 m, so the step was 0.83 voxels and the retry worked by accident; on the
// generated Cornell room they are 0.05 m and 0.094 m, so the step was **0.13
// voxels and could not cross a cell boundary at all**. The gate could never
// see it: `gi-src-surface.html` passes `world = { minCell: VOXEL }`, i.e. the
// field's own voxel, so the harness had the correct step all along and only
// the shipped call site had the wrong one.
//
// **AND FIXING IT BOUGHT NOTHING MEASURABLE, WHICH IS THE POINT OF SAYING SO.**
// Cornell after the record-pool fix read 43.85/43.94% unattributed at ultra
// with the broken step and 43.85/43.94% with the correct one (high 42.3→42.3,
// medium 9.1→8.6 — noise). So the retry is now what its comment claims and the
// residual unattributed fraction on that scene is NOT the face hazard. Whatever
// owns it is still open; do not re-derive this step looking for it.
//
// ══ WHERE THE PALETTE WENT (§10) ════════════════════════════════════════════
//
// Decision 3's palette — the CPU walk that fills it, the pass that copies it
// into `bits`, the reader that decodes it, the `emissiveOrphans` audit and the
// mean-albedo fallback — now lives in `srcSlotPalette.js`, keyed on nothing
// but a buffer, a word offset and a slot count, so the BVH transport can own
// one without an occupancy field. This file keeps what is CELL-KEYED: the
// record → stamp → slot lookup and the face retry. The field's own
// `paletteUniform`/`palettePass` are handed to the factory rather than
// rebuilt, so the words written to `bits` are the field's words and the one
// pass in `passes` is the field's pass — nothing is dispatched twice.
