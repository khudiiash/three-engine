 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS IS A RESOLUTION DECISION AND NEVER A PATH DECISION, and that
 * distinction is the entire reason it is safe where §16 R4 was not. R4 used
 * these same floors to move materials OUT of the exact-reflection path, and the
 * user's eyes refuted it in one night: the hit-shaded exact radiance is REAL
 * LIGHT (at grazing angles Fresnel drives rough-surface specular high), so
 * dropping it turned shadowed walls near-black. Nothing here changes which
 * terms a material compiles or which code path it takes — every surface keeps
 * the reflection it has today. The tier only says how many rays pay for it.
 * A wrong tier therefore costs SHARPNESS or SPEED, never energy.
 *
 * ## Why the ladder exists at all
 *
 * The engine had exactly TWO tiers: bucket 0 (mirror) and bucket 3 (everything
 * with a roughness map). On the user's Bistro that is **2 materials against
 * 102** — so window glass and wall plaster are in the same tier and get
 * identical treatment. Both halves of that are wrong at once: the glass is
 * denied the sharp trace it needs (its reflection arrives as a blurry, blobby
 * probe-field gather — the user's "blurry, noisy, dirty" windows), while the
 * plaster pays FULL-RESOLUTION PER-PIXEL BVH TRACING at ultra (25.77 ms of a
 * ~52 ms GPU frame) to produce something that is then blurred anyway.
 * User, 2026-08-24: *"for some surfaces we need much cleaner reflection while
 * others, like a wet carpet, would do with a very low res."*
 *
 * ## Why the FLOOR, not the mean
 *
 * The floor is the roughness LOWER BOUND over the map (§16 R4's per-channel p5).
 * Keying on it is deliberately conservative in the QUALITY direction: a surface
 * with any smooth region is traced finely across the whole surface, so the
 * ladder can never under-sample a mirror-like patch. It costs some perf on
 * mixed maps and cannot produce a sharpness regression, which is the right way
 * round for a change the user has to look at.
 *
 * An UNRESOLVED floor (the async GPU stat has not landed, or the roughness
 * expression is not one the bounded walk recognises) returns MEDIUM rather than
 * SHARP or COARSE — the middle is the only answer that is not a guess in either
 * direction, and §16 R4's existing `#refreshMirrorBucket` drain re-derives it
 * when the stat arrives.

 *
 * ══ WHY THE CLIP EXISTS, AND WHAT IT COST NOT TO HAVE IT ═══════════════════
 *
 * The contour formula (Baum et al.) integrates the WHOLE polygon whether or
 * not the receiver can see all of it, and the part below the tangent plane
 * integrates NEGATIVELY. This used to be answered with `max(faceSum, 0)` on
 * the face TOTAL, documented as "an under-estimate, smooth". It is neither.
 *
 * ⚠ **A HALF-VISIBLE FACE CLAMPED TO ZERO**, and since a box's opposing faces
 * are culled together by the facing test, a receiver sitting BETWEEN two of a
 * box's face planes lost every face at once. "Between two opposing face
 * planes" is exactly what it means for the emitter's mesh to OVERLAP the
 * receiver's — which is the user's 2026-08-20 report: *"the emitters do not
 * light surfaces if their meshes overlap with them, but when I move the
 * emitters lightly to the side they start emitting light"*.
 *
 * Measured against the brute-force MC arbiter (`test:gi-emitter-shapes`'s own
 * reference), a pillar face 0.05 m from a straddling emissive box read
 * **0.000 against a true 3.06**, stayed 0.14×–0.58× short through the whole
 * transition band, and snapped to 1.00× the instant the box cleared the
 * receiver's plane. A hard discontinuity in a physically smooth field — which
 * is why it reads as "no light at all" rather than "a little dim", and why
 * nudging the lamp fixes it.
 *
 * ⚠ **THE GATE PASSED THE WHOLE TIME.** Its horizon arm asserts only
 * `0 ≤ factor ≤ unoccluded MC` for straddling receivers — a bound that ZERO
 * satisfies. An interval that admits the failure is not a test of it; the arm
 * now compares against MC directly.
 *
 * ══ CLIP FIRST, INTEGRATE SECOND ═══════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Sutherland-Hodgman against `dot(v, N) = 0`, in LINEAR space — an edge meets
 * a plane linearly, the same point on the unit sphere does not, so normalizing
 * before the cut would bend every clipped edge. A quad cut by a plane keeps at
 * most 5 vertices, so the clip is Heitz's LTC 16-case config table (no dynamic
 * indexing, no loop): `config` is the four inside/outside bits, and each case
 * writes the survivors into a fixed 5-slot register file. Cases 5 and 10 —
 * opposite corners in, adjacent ones out — are geometrically impossible for a
 * convex quad and a plane, and fall out as n = 0.
 *
 * The unused tail slots are set to `L0` so the fixed 5-edge sum closes the

// `GICascadeLightNode.setup`, `analyticDirectAtRolled`, and `srcShade.js`'s
// `lightTermsAt`. Each of them carried its OWN copy of the attenuation, and the
// copies were a hardcoded inverse-square with a 1 m denominator floor. That was
// wrong twice over against the renderer the GI has to agree with:
//
//   · `decay` never arrived. three evaluates `1 / max(d^decay, 0.01)`
//     (`LightUtils.getDistanceAttenuation`); GI evaluated `1 / max(d², 1)`. A
//     lamp authored at any decay but 2 lit its bounce on a different curve from
//     its own direct light.
//   · the near-field floor differed by 100x. Inside a metre of a point light
//     three's attenuation keeps climbing to 100 and GI's stopped at 1 — a bulb
//     0.3 m off a ceiling delivered 11.1 to the raster and 1.0 to the bounce.
//
// And the cone never existed at all, so a spot light had no way into the slots:
// `GISystem#collectLightObjects` did not collect one, because a slot that
// ignores the cone would light a full sphere from it.
//
// So the model lives HERE, once, and every consumer calls it. Two terms:
//
//   DISTANCE  `getDistanceAttenuation` verbatim — the Frostbite windowed
//             falloff, `decay` as the exponent, the `distance` cutoff as the
//             window. Directional slots keep exactly 1 (`mix` on `isDir`).
//   CONE      `SpotLightNode.getSpotAttenuation` verbatim —
//             `smoothstep(cos(angle), cos(angle·(1−penumbra)), cos(θ))`.
//
// ⚠ THE CONE TERM IS BRANCHLESS, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES IT FREE FOR EVERY
// OTHER KIND. A directional or point slot publishes `coneCos = -2`,
// `penumbraCos = -1` (see GISystem's `#updateLightUniforms`): every cosine a
// real direction can produce is already at or past the upper edge, so the
// smoothstep is exactly 1 and the same expression serves all three kinds
// without a uniform read deciding which code runs. Which kind a slot holds
// stays a RUNTIME fact — R11: adding a light updates uniforms and never
// recompiles.
//
// Slots that predate these fields (the `gi-src-shade.html` fixture builds slot
// objects by hand) simply omit them, and the terms they gate compile out —
// `decay` absent reads as 2, `coneCos` absent emits no cone at all.

/**
 * Analytic (directional/point/spot) direct irradiance at an arbitrary world
 * point, from the shared GI light slots. UNSHADOWED by design.
 *
 * This exists for shading a REFLECTION HIT. A primary surface never needs it —
 * three's own lighting already evaluates the scene's real lights there, with
 * real shadow maps. But a point seen only in a mirror is not shaded by anyone:
 * without this, a reflected sunlit wall shows nothing but its indirect bounce
 * and reads several stops too dark, which is most of why exact reflections
 * looked wrong even when the geometry they resolved was exactly right.
 *
 * Unshadowed is the same trade the (now retired) per-material hit path made:
 * shadowing these costs up to MAX_GI_LIGHTS extra SDF marches per mirror pixel
 * to fix a subtle error INSIDE a reflection. Emitters — usually the dominant
 * light in a GI scene — stay shadowed via `emitterDirectAt`.
 *
 * `|N·L|`, not `max(0, N·L)`: the same both-sides convention the feedback
 * inject and the retired hit path use, because a BVH hit can land on a
 * single-sided wall whose winding faces away from the light.
 *
 * @param {Array} lightSlots uniform slots (see GISystem's `lightSlots`)
 * @param {*} P world position of the hit
 * @param {*} N unit normal at the hit
 * @returns irradiance (a TSL vec3 var)

/**
 * @param {boolean} [oneSided] — CLAMP the cosine instead of taking its absolute
 *   value. Default false, which keeps every existing caller byte-identical.
 *
 * ⚠ THE DEFAULT IS RIGHT FOR A FIELD CELL AND WRONG FOR A HIT, and the
 * distinction is already written down in this repo — `srcShade.js`'s
 * `lightTermsAt` header (§12.26.4):
 *
 *   "THE COSINE IS CLAMPED HERE, NOT ABSOLUTE. `analyticDirectAt` takes
 *    dot(dirTo, N).abs() because it shades a FIELD CELL, which has no definite
 *    side — a cell straddling a wall must light from either. A hit has a side:
 *    the normal was face-forwarded against the ray one line earlier, so abs()
 *    here would light the back of every wall from a lamp in front of it."
 *
 * `createGiBvhHitShade` shades a HIT — it face-forwards `nFace` against the
 * reflected ray and then called this function with the field-cell convention.
 * The consequence is the user's report: every reflected surface whose visible
 * face points AWAY from the sun received the sun's FULL irradiance, where the
 * same surface rendered directly receives exactly zero (three's `max(0, N·L)`
 * times its shadow map). That is roughly half of every reflected scene lit from
 * the wrong side — "materials that are very reflective ignore lighting,
 * appearing too bright", and at roughness 0.2 `exactWeight ~ 0.93`, so that
 * image replaces the surface response almost wholesale.
