// SPLIT RADIANCE CASCADES — THE GPU PROBE HASHMAP.
//
// Plan §4.1 steps [B]/[C]/[K], §4.2 "Buffers". This file owns the structure
// every later phase indexes through: an open-addressed, lock-free hashmap per
// cascade, the indirection table the map points into, and the slot lifecycle
// that keeps a surviving probe's index STABLE across frames.
//
// `srcRef.js`'s `SrcProbeMap` is the mirror. It is a compare-and-set in a JS
// loop, which has the same observable semantics as what runs here — first
// writer wins, every later writer finds its own key and gets the existing slot
// — and `scripts/gi-src-probes.html` diffs the two on the same key set,
// including a deliberate collision storm.
//
// ══ WHY CAS IS A wgslFn ISLAND AND NOT TSL ═════════════════════════════════
//
// TSL has no `atomicCompareExchangeWeak`. three r185 exposes load/store/add/
// sub/max/min/and/or/xor and stops there (AtomicFunctionNode's method table),
// and the insert is not expressible with any of them: `atomicMax` on the key
// would make the LARGEST key win a contended slot rather than the first, which
// is not a hashmap, and a load-then-store loop has a window where two probes
// claim one slot. So the insert is raw WGSL, on the vehicle `bvhGpu.js` and
// `dynamicObjects.js` already prove out (a `ptr<storage, …, read_write>`
// parameter that three's FunctionCallNode passes as `&buffer`).
//
// The hash function is NOT in the island. It is computed in TSL by
// `srcMathTsl.hashKey` and passed IN, because a second WGSL copy of the mix
// would be a second definition of the thing the twin gate exists to keep
// single — and a hash that disagrees with the mirror by one bit makes every
// probe-count comparison meaningless while looking perfectly healthy.
//
// ══ WHAT "WEAK" MEANS AND WHY THE LOOP IS SHAPED LIKE THIS ═════════════════
//
// `atomicCompareExchangeWeak` may fail SPURIOUSLY: it can report
// `exchanged == false` with `old_value == expected`. Advancing the probe
// sequence on that would scatter one key across several slots under
// contention, and the map would then hold duplicate entries for one probe —
// two indirection slots, two payloads, half the rays each. The loop therefore
// distinguishes the three outcomes explicitly and RETRIES THE SAME SLOT when
// the old value came back EMPTY.
//
// ══ THE SLOT LIFECYCLE, AND WHY THERE IS A FREE STACK ══════════════════════
//
// A surviving probe must keep the SAME indirection index frame to frame or its
// temporal history is meaningless (R6: an EMA smooths values, not membership).
// Two designs get there. Compacting the table each frame and copying payload
// is the obvious one and it is wrong — the payload is the expensive part and
// it would move every frame. So indices never move: the table is a fixed
// array, dead entries are pushed onto a free stack by the age pass, and new
// probes pop from it. A surviving probe is not touched at all, which is also
// why [K] costs nothing for the steady-state majority.
//
// ══ AND THE SAME LIFECYCLE CARRIES A SECOND RESOURCE ═══════════════════════
//
// Direction bins are the expensive per-probe payload — 32 bins at c0 rising to
// 2,048 at c3, nine words each — and they used to be addressed by probe SLOT,
// i.e. allocated for a capacity nothing ever fills. §12.16's gate measured
// **0.24% of allocated bins ever sampled**, and at a half-res 1080p gbuffer the
// scheme wanted 604 MB against a 128 MiB binding limit.
//
// So a probe CLAIMS a bin block when it is created and RELEASES it when it
// retires — the same stack, the same two passes, one more pop and one more
// push. `PROBE_BLOCK` holds the claim. The store owns the pool rather than
// `srcDeposit.js` for one concrete reason: `createCompactPass` already binds
// six storage buffers against a portable limit of eight, and a separate pair
// of pool buffers would have left the pass that creates every probe with no
// headroom at all. Plan §4.2, §12.18.3.

 * `write(i, indexNode)` stores the result. `SLOT_EMPTY` out means the key never

 * pipeline that means "a consumer is using this probe right now". Inserting
 * does not: a key CAS'd into a slot the age pass already re-populated finds the
 * entry present and touches nothing, so a probe that is looked up every single
 * frame still ages.
 *
 * That was not a hypothesis. Without this write, `createAgePass` retired every
 * live probe on the frame its age crossed the threshold and the compaction pass
 * immediately re-created it from the key still sitting in the hash — same
 * probe, NEW index, every `maxAge` frames, forever. The gate's storm and
 * stability arms both passed; only "survivors still hold their original indices
 * after the sweep" caught it, and in Phase 4 the symptom would have been the
 * whole frame's temporal history resetting on a beat.
 *
 * Threads racing to write 0 into one word all write the same value, so no
 * atomic is needed. Pass `touch: false` for a lookup that must NOT keep a probe
 * alive — a debug readback, say, which should show the retirement it is there
 * to observe rather than preventing it.

 * probe index, `probeTable[probe].block` → the block. Three storage buffers,
 * inside a kernel (`createGiResolve`, via [I]'s `gatherAt`) that already carries

 * written by a pass that runs after compaction has settled both halves. The
 * probe INDEX is never wanted by a gather — only its tile — so carrying it
 * through was pure indirection. 128 KB at the engine default, and it buys back
 * a binding on the fattest kernel in the module.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS: this must run AFTER `createCompactPass` and the resolve for

// cell, and then the ladder walks up — each c(i−1) probe inserting its nearest
// c(i) probe and keeping the link.
//
// ══ ONE PROBE PER PIXEL, NOT EIGHT ═════════════════════════════════════════
//
// A pixel inserts the NEAREST cell only, deliberately not the eight trilinear
// corners it will later interpolate over. The authors measured corner insertion
// as 2× the probes for little quality gain, and the renormalized sparse gather
// is what makes the missing corners harmless (srcMath's `sparseGather`). If a
// later phase reports interpolation holes, the fix is the gather's
// renormalization, not inserting more probes here.
//
// ══ THE LINK IS THREE THINGS AT ONCE ═══════════════════════════════════════
//
// `PROBE_PARENT` is the merge's parent pointer, Alg. 3's count-propagation
// edge, and the ancestor chain a split deposit walks. That is why it is
// resolved once here, at population time, rather than re-derived per ray: the
// deposit path in Phase 2 is the hottest loop in the module and a hash lookup
// per ray per cascade would be four lookups per ray.
