/**
 * One piece of level blockout — a wall, a floor slab, a staircase, a ramp, a
 * box, a column.
 *
 * ## One component with a `shape`, not seven components
 *
 * Mid-blockout you constantly discover that a wall wanted to be a doorway, or
 * that a floor should have been a platform one step up. With one component
 * that is a dropdown; with seven it is delete-and-redraw, losing the entity's
 * name, its place in the hierarchy, and anything already attached to it.
 *
 * ## It drives the entity's Mesh component rather than owning a mesh
 *
 * Same arrangement as Terrain, and for a reason that is easy to get wrong: a
 * mesh parented under the entity but outside a Mesh COMPONENT is invisible to
 * everything that reasons about scene geometry. `merging.js` collects
 * candidates by `entity.components.get("mesh")`, so a level of five hundred
 * private meshes would be five hundred draw calls that same-material merging
 * could not touch; the occlusion pass skips engine-owned objects, so the walls
 * — the best occluders a level has — would occlude nothing.
 *
 * So the piece computes geometry and hands it to the Mesh component, adding one
 * if the entity has none. Shadows, materials, picking, culling, GI and merging
 * then treat a blockout wall as exactly what it is: a mesh.
 *
 * Collision comes from a sibling Collider set to `mesh` (the editor adds one
 * when the physics module is on). The trimesh is built from the rendered
 * geometry at play start, so re-dragging a wall's length changes what the
 * player bumps into with no extra step.
