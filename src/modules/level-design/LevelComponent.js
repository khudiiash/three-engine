/**
 * The root of a blockout: the settings every piece under it is drawn with, and
 * the switch between greybox and the real thing.
 *
 * It holds no geometry. What it owns is the *authoring* state that would
 * otherwise be editor-only preferences — grid size, storey height, default
 * wall height — and that matters because those numbers are a property of the
 * level, not of whoever last opened it. Reopening a project a week later, or on
 * another machine, restores a 1 m grid and 3 m storeys because the level said
 * so, instead of whatever the tool happened to remember.
 *
 * `preview` flips the whole level between the greybox palette and the .mat
 * assets assigned to its pieces. It is on the Level rather than on each piece
 * so the toggle is one click during a walkthrough, and it is a saved prop
 * rather than a viewport toggle because "does this level have its materials
 * yet" is a real state of the work.
