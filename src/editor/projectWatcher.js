/**
 * Makes changes written to the project by anything other than the editor show
 * up without a restart.
 *
 * ## The gap this closes
 *
 * Everything the editor knows about the project on disk it read once and
 * cached: the Assets panel's directory listing, `assetLoader`'s path -> blob URL
 * map, the engine's decoded geometry / material / atlas / audio caches. None of
 * them can notice that the bytes changed. In-editor edits are fine, because the
 * code that writes also invalidates — but a file written by an AI agent using
 * its own file tools, by an IDE, by a paint program, or by a `git checkout`
 * simply never appeared. Restarting the editor "fixed" it, which is what made
 * this read as a broken feature rather than a missing one.
 *
 * The Rust side (`src-tauri/src/watcher.rs`) does the watching and filters out
 * the editor's own writes, so everything arriving here is genuinely external.
 *
 * ## Two policies, because assets and the open scene are not the same thing
 *
 * An asset on disk is the source of truth — the editor is only ever showing a
 * cached copy of it, so re-reading is always right. The open SCENE is the
 * opposite: the authoritative copy is the one in memory, with the user's
 * unsaved edits in it. Reloading that automatically would delete their work to
 * show them someone else's version. So a changed scene file reloads only when
 * the editor has nothing unsaved; otherwise it says so and leaves the decision
 * to the user.
