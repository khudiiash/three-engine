/**
 * Blender-style silhouette outline for the selected entities.
 *
 * WHY NOT A BOUNDING BOX. The viewport used to bracket the selection with a
 * world-axis-aligned wireframe box (`THREE.BoxHelper` / `Box3Helper`). A box is
 * cheap and tells you the extents, but it is a poor SELECTION cue: it hides the
 * thing you just clicked behind eight lines that belong to no surface, it says
 * nothing about which of two overlapping objects you actually hit, and on a
 * rotated or non-convex mesh the box is mostly empty space. Every DCC app
 * solves this the same way — trace the object's own silhouette.
 *
 * HOW. Screen space, in three passes — mask + horizontal dilate PRE-render
 * (updateSelectionOutlineMask), the final composite either as one post-render
 * quad (direct frames) or inside the postprocess pipeline's output node
 * (applySelectionOutlineOverlay) when one owns the camera:
 *
 *   1. MASK. Render only the selected meshes into an RGBA8 target with a flat
 *      override material: red channel = "selected", green channel = "active"
 *      (Blender's distinction — the active object is the one an operation acts
 *      on, and it gets the lighter orange). Depth testing is off, so this is a
 *      pure union-of-coverage mask, not a visibility test.
 *   2. DILATE. Grow the mask by `radius` pixels horizontally into a second
 *      target, then vertically inside the composite. A separable max filter
 *      costs 2*(2r+1) taps instead of the (2r+1)^2 a single-pass disc would.
 *   3. COMPOSITE. `dilated AND NOT mask` is exactly the ring of pixels within
 *      `radius` of a silhouette edge but outside the object — the outline.
 *      Drawn as a fullscreen quad over the finished frame.
 *
 * A geometric alternative (the "inverted hull": re-draw the mesh inflated along
 * its normals with front faces culled) needs no render targets at all, but it
 * splits open at every hard edge — the exact corners of the exact cube in the
 * screenshot this was written from — because a hard edge has no shared normal
 * to inflate along. Screen space has no such failure mode and gives a constant
 * pixel width regardless of distance, which is what makes the cue readable on a
 * far-away prop.
 *
 * WHY THE MASK PASS IS SAFE. The selected meshes are isolated by moving them
 * onto {@link SELECTION_MASK_LAYER} / {@link SELECTION_ACTIVE_LAYER} and
 * pointing the camera's layer mask at exactly that bit. Both the layer masks
 * and `visible` are saved and restored inside the same synchronous block, so
 * nothing else in the frame can observe them — which matters, because
 * `mesh.layers.mask` is part of the static-batching key (see `batching.js`) and
 * a bit left set across a rebuild would quietly pull a selected mesh out of its
 * batch, or leak the bit onto a batch proxy and drag the whole batch into the
 * mask.
 *
 * COST, measured on a 400-mesh scene at 1400x900 (submit time per frame, the
 * number the stats overlay calls "GPU"): 3.3ms with nothing selected, 4.5ms
 * with one object, 5.2ms with a hundred, 6.8ms with a 400-mesh subtree. So the
 * floor is ~1.2ms — three extra render calls (mask, dilate, composite) plus the
 * output blit each one costs — and it grows only with how much of the scene is
 * actually selected. Nothing is allocated or rendered when the selection is
 * empty.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMITS, deliberate:
 *   - The outline is not occluded. A selected object behind a wall still shows
 *     its silhouette, because the mask pass has no scene depth to test against
 *     and reading the main pass's depth back would cost more than the whole
 *     effect. In an editor "where did my selection go" is worth more than strict
 *     occlusion; Blender hides it, we don't.
 *   - Edges are crisp, not antialiased — same as every other editor overlay
 *     here (grid, gizmo, debug draw). A 4x multisampled mask target would fix
 *     it if that ever reads as cheap-looking.
 *   - Particles (`THREE.Sprite`) and impostor-swapped LOD levels get no
 *     outline: the override material can't reproduce a sprite's billboard
 *     vertex transform, and an impostor's billboard doesn't live under the
 *     entity's own `object3D`.

 *
 * WHY: a WebGPU render pipeline is per material × geometry layout × render
 * context. The mask pass draws the selected meshes with an override material
 * into its own RGBA8/no-depth target, so the FIRST time any given mesh is
 * selected, that pipeline does not exist yet and compiles synchronously inside
 * the frame — the reported "it lags each time I select another object".
 * `renderer.compileAsync` walks the same projection path `render` does, so
 * running it with the override + the mask target bound builds exactly the
 * pipelines the mask pass will ask for, off the critical path.
 *
 * compileAsync's setup (projection, render-object creation, pipeline REQUESTS)
 * is synchronous — its only awaits are `init()` (already done) and the final
 * pipeline promises — so the override/target are restored immediately after
 * the call returns and the compiles finish in the background.
 *
 * LIMIT: `compileAsync` frustum-culls, so this warms the meshes the camera can
 * currently see — which covers click-selection by construction. Selecting an
 * OFF-SCREEN entity from the hierarchy can still compile on first draw; call
 * this again after big camera jumps if that ever reads as a hitch.

  // buffers via the occluder pass. (2) Pipelines key on the lights node, and

  // pass will bind. Hide → synchronous projection → restore happens inside
