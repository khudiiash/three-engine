/**
 * Rubber-band ("marquee") selection in the 3D viewport.
 *
 * The obvious implementation — project each object's bounding box to screen and
 * intersect two 2D rects — is wrong the moment the camera is inside or behind
 * something: a corner behind the near plane projects to a MIRRORED point, so a
 * wall you are standing next to reports a screen rect on the wrong side of the
 * viewport, and the room you are in is either always or never selected. So the
 * test runs in 3D instead: the marquee is turned into a frustum and every
 * candidate's world AABB is tested against it. Behind-the-camera geometry falls
 * out for free, and the same code works for an orthographic axis view.
 *
 * "Touch" semantics, like Blender and Godot: a box that grazes the marquee is
 * selected. Requiring full containment makes large objects nearly unselectable.
 *
 * Cost is split deliberately. The candidate list (one AABB per drawn mesh) is
 * built ONCE at drag start — the camera is pinned while the marquee is up and
 * the scene isn't changing — so each pointermove is 6 plane tests per candidate
 * and nothing else. Rebuilding candidates per move would re-walk the scene
 * graph 60 times a second on a scene with thousands of meshes.
