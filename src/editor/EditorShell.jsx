/**
 * Double-click a tab (or the empty part of a tab bar) to fill the window with
 * that panel; double-click again to put it back.
 *
 * The same gesture both ways, and no keyboard exit. Escape used to un-maximize,
 * and that was wrong far more often than it was right: inside a maximized panel
 * Escape is the key that cancels a transform, closes a popover, drops a picker
 * or leaves a modal tool, and every one of those presses also threw away the
 * layout the user had deliberately asked for. A gesture that only the tab bar
 * can trigger can't be hit while working inside the panel.
 *
 * Dockview has the maximize API but binds no gesture to it, so a panel can only
 * be enlarged by dragging splitters — and there is no way at all to get a
 * temporarily-bigger viewport or paint canvas without wrecking the layout you
 * then have to rebuild by hand.
 *
 * Bound to the TAB BAR, never to the panel body: panel bodies are full of
 * double-click handlers already (renaming a layer, a keyframe, a graph node),
 * and a gesture that sometimes renames a layer and sometimes swallows the whole
 * screen is worse than no gesture.
