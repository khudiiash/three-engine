/**
 * Undo/redo for a node-graph editor.
 *
 * Deliberately LOCAL to the editor rather than routed through the scene-level
 * `commandBus` (src/editor/commands/CommandBus.js). That bus is entity-level
 * and calls `sceneStore.refresh()` after every entry; pushing a graph edit per
 * keystroke or per drag frame through it would flood the global history and
 * re-render the whole editor. Graph *commits* still go through the command bus
 * (the particle panel's `SetComponentPropCommand`), so an applied effect is
 * still undoable at scene level — this is the finer-grained layer underneath.
 *
 * Snapshot-based, not diff-based: a graph is a few hundred small plain objects,
 * so a structural copy costs nothing next to the React Flow re-render that
 * follows it, and snapshots can't drift out of sync the way inverse-op diffs do.
