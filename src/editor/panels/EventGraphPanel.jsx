/**
 * The event graph for the selected entity's Events component.

 * A panel rather than an inspector section because a graph needs room — the
 * same reason Shader Graph and Particles are panels. The Events component's
 * inspector keeps the row list, which is the right editor for "when X, do these
 * three things", and offers a button through to here for the wiring rows cannot
 * express: a branch, a value passed between actions, several triggers sharing
 * one chain.
 *
 * Both run. The graph is not a view of the rows and the rows are not a
 * flattened graph — converting between them would be lossy in the direction
 * that matters, and a lossy round-trip through an editor is how authored work
 * quietly disappears.
