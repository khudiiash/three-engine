// The editor's runtime engine. The actual Engine class plus all component
// classes and shader/particle graphs live in a heavy module graph (pulls in

// boot path cheap we defer that import — and the `new Engine()` itself —
// until the first `await ensureEngine()` at a real entry point. The throw
// on direct `engine.X` access exists to catch any consumer that forgets to
// await; replace with `engineInstance` once it's resolved.

/**
 * The one Engine, and the one in-flight load, held VM-wide.
 *
 * These were plain module-level `let`s, which is a singleton only while the
 * module is evaluated once — and this one is not. Vite serves a touched module
 * as both `foo.js` and `foo.js?t=<mtime>`, so a second evaluation used to
 * construct a SECOND `Engine`: ops would spawn entities into an engine nothing
 * was rendering, the viewport kept drawing the first one, and the edit only
 * appeared after a restart (when the autosaved scene was reloaded into a single
 * fresh instance). Two engines is the worst version of the split-brain
 * described in `singleton.js`, because every downstream store is keyed off
 * whichever one its module happened to capture.
