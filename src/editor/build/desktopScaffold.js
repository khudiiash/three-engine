/**
 * The desktop target emits a *Tauri project* around the web build rather than
 * a finished executable.
 *
 * Producing an .exe/.app/.deb needs a Rust toolchain and a platform-native
 * linker, and it can only ever target the machine doing the building — the
 * editor cannot honestly promise "click here for a Windows, macOS and Linux
 * release". What it can do is remove every decision between a working web
 * build and `npm run tauri build`: the config, the Cargo manifest, the entry
 * point, the icon and the WebGPU flag are all filled in from the project's own
 * settings, so the remaining step is one command that either works or tells you
 * to install Rust.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure string generator so `npm run test:build` can assert
 * the shape of what ships. No Tauri, no DOM.

This folder is a complete Tauri project wrapped around the web build in \`web/\`.
Nothing here needs editing; it is generated from the project's Build Settings.

## Build an installer

    npm install
    npm run build

The result lands in \`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/\`.

## Requirements

* [Rust](https://rustup.rs) — the native shell is compiled, not downloaded.
* Tauri's platform prerequisites: <https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/>
* A build targets **the machine it runs on**. Cross-compiling to another OS is
  a separate exercise; the usual answer is to run this on each platform (or in
  CI) rather than to cross-compile.

## Notes

* \`--enable-unsafe-webgpu\` is already set in \`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json\`.
  Removing it gives a black window on Windows.
* Replace \`src-tauri/icons/icon.png\` and run \`npm run tauri icon src-tauri/icons/icon.png\`
  to regenerate the full platform icon set (\`.ico\`, \`.icns\`, the PNG ladder)
  before shipping — a single PNG is enough to build, not to look finished.
* The web build in \`web/\` is the same output as the Web target, so
  \`${name}\` can be published to a browser host and packaged as a desktop app
  from one export.
