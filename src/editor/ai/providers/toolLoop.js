 * solve on its own: driving the CLI's own opaque agent loop means tool
 * availability was never ours to control (`--tools ""` blocks Bash but also
 * silently breaks MCP tool_use — see the ai-workflows project memory). Here
 * we own the request, so the tool set is closed by construction — the model
 * can only be handed the tools we put in `tools:[]`, and `callTool` refuses
 * anything not on the workflow's allowlist even if it tried to invent one.
 *
 * Deliberately not streaming: Ollama does not support incremental tool-call
 * deltas, and per-tool-call progress lines (emitted as each call completes)
 * give a user watching the AI panel better feedback than token streaming
 * would anyway. `parseStreamEvent.js` is untouched by this file on purpose —
 * it stays the claudeCli provider's parser; this loop produces
 * `{lines, result, meta}` directly, matching what `aiStore.handleEvent`
 * already destructures from a claudeCli event, without going through it.

 *
 * A `role: "tool"` message is plain TEXT on every OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
 * so a base64 image sent this way is not an image the model can look at; it
 * is ~1 MB of gibberish characters. That is not merely useless, it is
 * actively harmful: it buries the real tool results, blows a local model's
 * context window, and invites the model to invent a description of the
 * picture it "received". A live run did exactly that — a small local model
 * confidently described a Genshin Impact screenshot, HP bars and all, for a
 * scene containing one light. The marker below is deliberately explicit that
 * the model did NOT see anything, so it has no excuse to describe it.
 *
 * Passing screenshots properly means a vision-capable model plus an
 * `image_url` content part on a follow-up `user` message (a tool message
 * cannot carry one) — worth doing, but it needs a per-model capability flag,
 * since sending an image part to a text-only model is its own error. Until
 * then, refusing to send the bytes is the correct behaviour. The claudeCli
 * provider is unaffected: it passes screenshots as real image content over
 * MCP, which is why it is the default (see aiPrefs.js).
