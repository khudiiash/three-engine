/**
 * The editor's half of the MCP bridge.
 *
 * Dials the local bridge WebSocket (`mcp/broker.mjs`), advertises the op registry
 * as a tool manifest, and executes forwarded calls against the live editor. The
 * direction is dictated by the browser: a page cannot listen on a socket, so the
 * editor is always the client.
 *
 * What is on the other end is a broker daemon, not any one assistant's MCP
 * server — that indirection is what lets several assistants drive this editor at
 * once (see `mcp/broker.mjs`). Nothing in this file had to change for that,
 * which was the point: the greeting and the request/reply shapes below are the
 * same ones the bridge has always spoken.
 *
 * ## Reconnecting is the normal case, not the error case
 *
 * The bridge outlives individual conversations now, but not the machine: the
 * broker exits once nothing has been attached for a while, and comes back when
 * the next assistant starts. So a failed connection is still expected and must
 * be quiet: the backoff below tops out at 15s and logs only on the transitions a
 * user cares about (connected, and the first failure after a successful
 * connection). An earlier version logged every attempt and filled the console
 * with a line every two seconds whenever no assistant was running.
 *
 * ## Everything runs through `EditorApi.callTool`
 *
 * Not `callOp`: `callTool` resolves `{ ok, error }` instead of throwing, which
 * is exactly the shape a transport needs, and it applies the registry's
 * argument validation. A model on the other end WILL send a string where a
 * number belongs, and the error it gets back should name the parameter.
