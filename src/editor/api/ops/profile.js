/**
 * GPU frame profiling — where the milliseconds actually go.

 * viewport is a fraction of a real one, and screen-space GI cost is per-pixel,
 * so its numbers do not extrapolate. The measurement has to happen in the
 * editor that is actually slow.
 *
 * `profile.giPasses` dispatches each GI pass on its own, K times, with the
 * WebGPU timestamp queries resolved around it — so every pass reports its own
 * cost at the resolution the user is really running. It suspends the render
 * loop for the duration (otherwise the editor's own dispatches land inside the

 * The other half of the frame, and the half nobody could see.

 * — the scene draw and every postprocess effect — is a RENDER pass, and for two
 * sessions the only way to attribute it was subtraction: total minus GI minus a
 * postprocess-off A/B run by hand. That arithmetic said the scene draw costs
 * ~16 ms for 262 k triangles on a 4070, which is absurd per-triangle and
 * therefore per-PIXEL, and left ~26 ms of a 33 ms frame unattributed across
 * SSR + 5 blurs, GTAO, 11 Bloom passes and Godrays. Guessing which of those
 * owns the frame is exactly what this op exists to stop.
 *
 * HOW: post effects declare their work in `updateBefore` — the hook the node
 * system calls to render an effect's own passes before the quad that samples
 * them. Calling it directly, K times, with `resolveTimestampsAsync("render")`
 * around the batch gives that effect's real GPU cost at the real resolution.
 * The scene draw comes along for free: `PassNode` is a node in the same graph
 * and its `updateBefore` IS `renderer.render(scene, camera)`.
 *
 * ⚠ FILTER ON `updateBeforeType`, NOT ON THE METHOD. The base `Node` class
 * defines an empty `updateBefore`, so `typeof node.updateBefore === "function"`
 * matches every node in the graph and would report hundreds of 0.00 ms rows.
 * `updateBeforeType` is `'none'` unless a node actually opts in.
