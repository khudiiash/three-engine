/**
 * Seeing and aiming: the ops that let an assistant look at the scene it is
 * building instead of reasoning about it purely from numbers.
 *
 * This is the single largest capability gap the API had. Everything else here
 * reads or writes structure — names, transforms, component props — and none of
 * it answers "does this look right?". A wall placed one unit off, a light
 * inside geometry, a material that came out black: all invisible to a caller
 * that can only read transforms, and all obvious in one frame.
 *
 * ## Capture goes through a render target, not the canvas
 *
 * The obvious `canvas.toDataURL()` does not work here. The canvas is a WebGPU
 * surface; after a frame is presented its contents are not guaranteed to be
 * readable, and three's WebGPU backend does not configure the context with a
 * preserved drawing buffer. So we render one extra frame into an offscreen
 * `RenderTarget` and read that back — which also decouples the screenshot's
 * resolution from whatever size the panel happens to be, and lets a caller ask
 * for a small image (the default) rather than paying for a 4K readback that a
 * model will only see downscaled anyway.

/**
 * World-space bounds of an entity's renderable content, including descendants.
 *
 * ## Why this does not use `getEntityBoundingSphere`
 *
 * It used to, and it was wrong in two independent ways that both made the
 * answer fiction rather than an approximation.
 *
 * The box came from `Sphere.getBoundingBox`, so it was always a CUBE. A box
 * mesh scaled [4, 1, 1] reported a size of [6.93, 6.93, 6.93] — the Y extent
 * seven times too large — which is worse than useless for the one question the
 * op exists to answer ("how much room does this take up?"). The radius was
 * `geometryRadius × max(scale)` rather than the real circumscribed sphere, so
 * it was only correct under uniform scale.
 *
 * And the sphere came out of the CULLING cache, which is keyed on the entity's
 * world translation. Geometry that loads asynchronously — every mesh backed by
 * a `geometryAsset`, every imported model — swaps in without the entity moving,
 * so the cache kept answering with the placeholder unit box it was primed with.
 * The Sponza atrium floor, a 40 m slab, reported a 1.73 m cube. The engine's own
 * GI auto-fit disagreed with it by a factor of 24 on the same entity.
 *
 * So: a real AABB, expanded from each mesh's geometry bounding box through that
 * mesh's world matrix, computed fresh every call. `Box3.expandByObject` does
 * exactly this and re-reads geometry bounds rather than trusting a cache.
 * `entity.getBounds` is called by hand, a handful of times a session — the
 * culling cache exists for the per-frame path and has no business here.
