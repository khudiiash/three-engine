/**
 * The editor's code editor: one Monaco instance configuration, shared by the
 * Code panel and the Inspector's inline editor.
 *
 * ## Why an embedded editor at all
 *
 * The point of this app is that a game can be made without leaving it. Sending
 * the user to VS Code to change one line of a script breaks that in the most
 * ordinary case there is, and "Open in IDE" is still here for when the user
 * genuinely wants their own setup — it just isn't the only way to read a file
 * anymore.
 *
 * ## Why Monaco rather than a highlighter
 *
 * A syntax-highlighted read-only view would have been a tenth of this. It
 * would also have been the wrong thing: the scripting surface is deliberately
 * fully typed (`engine.d.ts` is generated so a script never has to look
 * anything up), and that investment only pays off in an editor with a real
 * language service. Monaco carries TypeScript's, so the in-app editor gets the
 * same completions, hovers, signature help and inline errors the user's IDE
 * would give them — against the same declarations, from the same file.
 *
 * ## Type declarations, in two tiers
 *
 * `engine.d.ts` / `editor.d.ts` are bundled into the app as raw strings
 * (`projectTypes.js` already imports them to scaffold projects), so they are
 * registered synchronously at setup: the API the user actually writes against
 * is known before the first keystroke.
 *
 * three's declarations are ~970 files vendored per-project on disk, far too
 * much to block on. They load in the background on first use, over a single
 * batched `read_text_files` call, and `three` resolves to `any` until they
 * land. That ordering matters: blocking startup on 12 MB of `@types/three`
 * would make opening a script feel broken, whereas `Vector3` going from `any`
 * to typed a second later is invisible.
