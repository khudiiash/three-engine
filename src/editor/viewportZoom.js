/**
 * Distance-aware wheel dolly, shared by the scene viewport and the geometry
 * editor.
 *
 * OrbitControls zooms by scaling the camera's distance to `controls.target`,
 * so one notch always moves the same FRACTION of *that* distance — and the
 * pivot is wherever you last framed something. Press F on a doorknob and the
 * pivot sits 30cm away; every notch after that moves 1.5cm, no matter that
 * the wall you are flying at is forty metres off. The steps shrink
 * geometrically as you approach the pivot, so the view crawls to a halt and
 * never gets past it. Blender has exactly this failure, which is why it ships
 * "Zoom to Mouse Position" and "Auto Depth" as the cure.
 *
 * The cure, implemented here:
 *   - the step is a fraction of the distance to whatever is actually UNDER
 *     THE CURSOR, so it is always scaled to the thing you are flying at;
 *   - the camera travels along the cursor ray, so that thing stays put on
 *     screen instead of sliding out of frame;
 *   - the orbit pivot is re-anchored onto the same surface, so the next orbit
 *     turns around what you just zoomed to rather than around the doorknob;
 *   - the step has a floor tied to the near plane, so you can always push
 *     through a surface you are pressed against and always pull back out.
 *
 * The pivot is always placed straight ahead of the camera, so `update()`'s
 * `lookAt(target)` is a no-op and a zoom never rotates the view.
 *
 * Orthographic views are left to OrbitControls: they zoom by scaling the
 * projection, which has no pivot and therefore none of this problem.

/**
 * ⛔ SKINNED MESHES ARE NOT CANDIDATES, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE COST.
 *
 * `THREE.SkinnedMesh.raycast` computes the SKINNED position of every vertex it
 * tests, on the CPU, through the full bone chain — and `pickAcceleration.js`
 * deliberately builds no bounds tree for one (a bind-pose BVH is wrong for a
 * posed mesh), so a skinned mesh always takes the stock linear scan. The
 * user's Sponza carries a 104-bone character of 55 320 triangles across two
 * skinned meshes; every probe re-cast paid for all of it on the main thread.
 *
 * That is why ZOOM froze and ORBIT did not: orbit never casts a ray, and the
 * probe re-casts whenever the cursor moves, the cache ages out, or the camera
 * flies PAST the pivot surface — which is what zooming in does, every notch.
 *
 * A character is not a thing you fly at, and even if it were, a depth from its
 * bind pose would be the wrong depth. Excluding it costs nothing real.
 *
 * The candidate walk also moves `isPickVisible`/`isSceneObject` BEFORE the
 * raycast instead of filtering hits afterwards: an editor overlay that was
 * going to be discarded should not be intersected first.
