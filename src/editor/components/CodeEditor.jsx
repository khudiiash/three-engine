 * Code panel shows the same unsaved text, with the same undo history, and one
 * save covers both.
 *
 * ## Saving
 *
 * Explicit, on ⌘/Ctrl+S or the button, and on unmount if the buffer is dirty.
 * Not on every keystroke: script files are watched for hot reload, so an
 * autosave would recompile the user's game on a half-typed identifier, several
 * times a second, and fill the console with errors about code they are still
 * in the middle of writing.
 *
 * ## Files changing underneath
 *
 * The same file can be rewritten by an import, an AI action, or the user's own
 * IDE. On regaining focus this re-reads from disk and adopts the new contents
 * *only when the buffer is clean* — a dirty buffer means unsaved user work,
 * and silently replacing that is the one unforgivable thing a text editor can
 * do. When both changed, it says so and leaves the choice alone.
