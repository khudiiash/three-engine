 * renderer's points get their own section.
 *
 * The live readout is not decoration. Every question an author has about an LOD
 * group is "which level am I looking at, and why" — and the whole point of a
 * good LOD chain is that you cannot tell by looking. Without the measured
 * screen height next to the thresholds, tuning one means guessing, moving the
