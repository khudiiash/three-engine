/**
 * Impostor inspector (roadmap item 14).
 *
 * The bake is asynchronous, deduplicated across every prop that shares a mesh,
 * and can fail — none of which the schema-driven rows can express. What an
 * author needs to know is exactly three things: is there an atlas yet, what did
 * it cost, and how many props are sharing it. The last one is the number that
 * says whether the feature is doing its job: a forest reporting "1 draw call,
 * 500 instances" is working, and one reporting 500 batches is not.
