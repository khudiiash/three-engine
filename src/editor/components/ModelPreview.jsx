/**
 * An interactive GLB preview: drag to turn it, pick which animation plays.
 *
 * Built for the asset browsers, where "what am I about to import" is a question
 * a thumbnail cannot answer. A still image of an animated character tells you
 * nothing about whether its walk cycle is usable, and Poly Pizza's catalogue is
 * full of models whose whole value is the clips they ship with.
 *
 * ## Why its own renderer
 *
 * The editor's main WebGPU canvas is claimed by the viewport (see
 * viewportCanvas.js) and cannot be borrowed for a thumbnail. So this owns a
 * small `WebGPURenderer` of its own, like the Asset Inspector's preview and the
 * material/geometry previews do — and, like them, runs through
 * `throttlePreviewFrame`, which caps it at 30fps and skips entirely when the
 * canvas is not visible. That cap is not politeness: a second swapchain
 * presenting at 120Hz serialises against the viewport's present and shows up as
 * viewport frame drops.
 *
 * Exactly one of these is alive at a time in practice (it renders the SELECTED
 * model, and there is one selection), which is what makes a per-instance
 * renderer affordable.
 *
 * ## Loading
 *
 * `src` is passed to the loader as-is. Remote sources therefore have to be
 * CORS-readable — Poly Pizza's CDN sends `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so
 * the bytes load straight into the webview with no Rust proxy in the way. A
 * host that does not would need `fetch_bytes` and a blob URL instead.
 *
 * A source that is not glTF at all passes `load` instead: an async function
 * returning `{ scene, animations }`, the two fields of a GLTF this component
 * actually reads. ambientCG's models are OBJ+MTL inside a ZIP and have no URL
 * a loader could be pointed at, so they build their scene themselves and hand
 * it over. `src` is still required alongside it — it is the cache key the load
 * effect keys off, so two different models never share a render.
 *
 * ## Interaction
 *
 * It turntables on its own until you touch it, then hands over: showing the
 * model off is the point of the first two seconds, and fighting an auto-spin
 * while trying to look at something is the point of nothing. Drag turns,
 * wheel dollies, and both are clamped so the model cannot be lost off-screen.
